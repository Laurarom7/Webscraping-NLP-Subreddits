2,Books on technique,"I took a 3-year break from climbing and recently started again. I need to regain a lot of strength of course, but I also grabbed my old friend the *Self-Coached Climber* to review what I remember about technique. The chapters about balance, body awareness, turning/flagging and movement were a nice refreshment.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed the book is from 2004 and a quick Google search told me no new editions has been released since then. I wondered if by now there are any newer (better) books out there with new insights to help me improve technique. Because in the end, the *Self-Coached Climber* sometimes is a little outdated (promoting the *arqué* without warning and such).",climbing

5,Finger pain: when is it fine to keep climbing and when should it be considered like a warning?,"Coming from a few years of body building, I know that pain isn't necessarily something bad, and if it's a muscular pain due to lactic acid, it is usually safe to work on it. However, I believe fingers are completely different and I never know when a bit of pain is fine for climbing or if it could lead to a serious injury.

I started bouldering two years ago and I never had any particular pain, although recently (about 3 months ago), I started pushing myself with some more difficult problems like 6b+/6c. Since then, I started experiencing some pain in the ""flashy part"" of my fingers. It usually disappear completely after warming up, but it sometimes remain until the end of the training. When I'm not training, it also happens that a very specific movement of a finger, or a very localised area, feels particularly painful, like pinching my thumb and finger while holding my hand behind my back!

My question is, based on your experience, when should I start worrying, and what do you suggest doing when the pain a ""dangerous one""?

Thank you for your comments =) ",climbing

tl:dr, I’m buying 4 or 5 climbing area books/guides as a wedding gift for some crusher friends (trad, adventure, sport). What are your top three climbing area books and why?
Edit: Feel free to list your top 3 climbing areas (with our without guide books) too!

My good friends are getting married in the next few weeks and I’m working hard to get them a cool wedding present. 
They both crush and love to travel (for adventure and for climbing).
One loves trad (we live in Utah so he’s very familiar with Indian creek and LCC). And adventure climbing, the other enjoys trad/adventure but really loves sport climbing as well.
They’re both interested in environmental conservation. One is fluent in Spanish and the other in Mandarin. 
With all of that in mind I’m thinking about buying them 4 or 5 climbing area books of places they love or would someday travel to. What are your top 3 favorite climbing area books and why? What are your top 3 climbing areas and why?

Beautiful books get bonus points as well! I’m a huge fan of the new Yangshuo climbing guide!

Edit: In response to everyone who is suggesting local guidebooks: In the past I've gone halfsies with the groom on 2 or 3 guidebooks so I know he's got a stack of (half-owned) books at his place for all the Utah places he likes (Joes, Moab, The creek, SLC area, Ibex, and Maple).

20,Shoulder Dislocation Bouldering," 

Hi guys,

In 2015  I dislocated my shoulder whilst falling awkwardly out of a handstand, the shoulder fell back in without too much effort although later that day I re-dislocated it which took a larger amount of effort to relocate. After the accident I was advised by an orthopaedic surgeon to work on strengthening the ligaments and muscles around the shoulder, and surgery might be avoidable. Over the past three years at times it has left unstable, but I have slowly worked on physical therapy till now where it has been feeling almost pain free and feeling stable . Since starting bouldering I’ve worked even more on strengthening my shoulders, understanding the stress they are under due to the sport. This in mind, while on a wall last Sunday I’ve had my left arm extended at 60 degrees and crimped down hard next thing I know I’m lying on the mat with my shoulder dislocated. I was able to manipulate my body against the mat as I could feel it would go back in. My question; is there any possibility of recovering from this without a shoulder stabilisation surgery and continue climbing? Does anyone have experience or understanding of this procedure are there any risks involved such as loss of mobility or re-occurring problems?  Would surgery with physio along with stretch therapy result in the best outcome? Or should it be avoided?

I’ve had my MRI I’m waiting for the report and will be seeing an orthopaedic surgeon in the next couple days. Would really appreciate opinion on if a conservative treatment could work. 

Thanks for your time, 

Sorry i'm not sure where the most appropriate place would be to make this post.

22,Too old for this?,"I learned the basics of climbing when I was 17, in a high school gym class oriented towards the outdoors. Challenge Gym, it was called. We learned to climb, rappel, tie knots, make our own webbing harnesses, one-handed bowlines, and how to belay. I worked for a local outfitter for years, but it was a commercial operation , and I did not meet many people willing to share climbing with me. It was some special club I couldn’t join.


I haven’t done any of this in many years. I’m 42 now, I’ve had my kids and they’re old enough to climb and mountain bike.

In general I’ve felt like the outdoors community, despite its Welcome Everyone! Vibe, is anything but. I wasn’t born to climbing so I’m not welcome. 

And now, I’m too old, or so I’m told. I can Gym climb for fun, but I’ll never get on a real rock. Yes, a gym climber told me this. I should just view this as a workout.

Sp, how do I progress? I’ve been momming for over 11 years. Is my life of adventure over because I’m too old, missed my window?

We didn't actually catch fire, but the building next door to us was so badly damaged by the fire that it's had to be completely demolished.

It's going to take us in total about a week and a half to clear up after the smoke damage. This is also going to include a reset of the entire centre as each hold has to soaked in Benky and then jetwashed to get them completely clean.

Some of the GB Climbing Team have very kindly offered to come in and help us reset this week, but it's still going to be a big job setting over 200 problems in 5 days!

The photo is what used to be our hold store, and you can see the demolished building through the hole. This is actually a result of part of the other buildings roof crashing down on us during the fire.

I have multi-colored heat shrink tubing.

Should I put it on my (gym, lead) rope? Are there downsides?  Will it get stuck in things? (Though it has some labels at the ends that would also get stuck in things if so.)  

Should I put it after the labels or over top of them?

My rope is blue, and heat shrink comes in red yellow blue black.  What colors should I use?  :D

Am I overthinking this?",climbing

90,Asian Games Women's Final recap,"They started the day with speed. This was my first time watching a full speed comp start to finish so I wasn't sure wth was going on, other than that the person who tags the thing at the top first wins. I thought they were going to just rank athletes by time, but they did a full set of head-to-head races to determine the 1-6 rank. The rankings after the speed round was:

Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Sa | 1 | - | - | 1
Marlenova | 2 | - | - | 2
Lee | 3 | - | - | 3
Ito | 4 | - | - | 4
Kim | 5 | - | - | 5
Noguchi | 6 | - | - | 6


The bouldering round really separated out the competitors. On F1, Lee and Marlenova couldn't even reach the zone(bonus) hold. Kim had trouble with F2 because of her height. F3 was a big disappointment on the setters because the beta was broken. Everyone who topped F3 used the zone hold only as a foot; they didn't even bother to tag it with a hand just for the bonus point and instead just took it to the top. Marlenova was the only one to not top this, and she touched the zone hold with her hands when she tried to dyno to it out of desperation. F4 was similar. The setters probably wanted the climbers to sideways-dyno into a double-gaston. No one did that, and instead just went straight up. This put the climbers in a weird spot where they had to basically downclimb a move to tag the zone hold, and a couple of them almost fell doing so.


Climber | F1 | F2| F3 | F4 | Total
-|-|-|-|-|-
Noguchi | T | T | T | T | 4T4z
Ito | T | T | T | z | 3T4z
Kim | T | z | T | z | 2T4z
Sa | z | T | T | z | 2T4z
Lee | - | z | T | z | 1T3z
Marlenova | - | z | - | - | 0T1z


Rankings after Speed+Boulder:


Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Sa | 1 | 4 | - | 4
Noguchi | 6 | 1 | - | 6
Ito | 4 | 2 | - | 8
Marlanova | 2 | 6 | - | 12
Kim | 5 | 3 | - | 15
Lee | 3 | 5 | - | 15


I don't know how tiebreakers work but whatever rule they use, Kim beats Lee, so Lee went first. This was 4th day on climbing for these athletes after 3 straight days of quals. They all looked tired. Lee fought the pump as much as she could before falling around halfway up. Marlenova was clearly already out of gas towards the end of the bouldering round, and ended up only making a handful of moves up the wall. Kim took it to the top like a champ. She didn't look that tired either. The final move to the top hold was a dyno and she caught it with room to spare. She probably knew this guaranteed her a medal as she got a bit emotional celebrating at the top. Ito made good progress until her knee popped and she fell. I got a little uneasy watching them climb this route because there were lots of tweaky-looking heel hooks - those that you bring your foot up to your waist height and your leg goes sideways horizontal. Ito was in the middle of a leftward cross move with her right leg in this position and ended up getting injured. She was clutching her right knee as she got lowered and remained on the ground even after getting lowered. She had to get carried out on a board. Noguchi looked like she had a pretty good chance of taking it to the top as well but looks like the fatigue finally caught up to her. At this point, Sa was guaranteed a silver and needed to best Noguchi's position for the gold. She looked like she was well on her way until she fell just about where Ito fell. I think she made a mistake and slipped. Sa herself looked pretty disappointed as well.


Climber | Hold
- | -
Kim | Top
Noguchi | 40+
Sa | 37+
Ito | 36+
Lee | 23+
Marlenova | 12+


Final standings :


Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Noguchi | 6 | 1 | 2 | 12
Sa | 1 | 4 | 3 | 12
Kim | 5 | 3 | 1 | 15
Ito | 4 | 2 | 4 | 32
Marlenova | 2 | 6 | 6 | 72
Lee | 3 | 5 | 5 | 75


I still don't know how tiebreakers work because Noguchi won gold. I thought Sa would win gold based on her first place qual finish but I guess that's not how the rules are written. Also, 2-6-6 looks worse than 3-5-5 but again, that's just how the points are calculated.


The men's finals will start in a bit but I won't be watching that as I have other things to do. My guess is Tomoa gold, Chon silver, Kokoro bronze.",climbing

I’ve been thinking about going to massage therapy school, but I’ve heard that the work is really hard in your hands/arms, and I’m worried that I wouldn’t be able to climb anymore. Or, alternatively, that climbing has messed up my hands already to the point where massage would be difficult in the first place. I figured there’s gotta be some people on this sub who do massage therapy and who I can chat with about the combo to see if my worries are valid, if you guys have any tips, etc. 
Thanks in advance :)",climbing
93,Advice for building mind-body connection?,"I've been a desk jockey my whole life. Due to life circumstance, I was never exposed to sports or really physical activity much at all and used video games as escape, and eventually my career. Luckily I never got significantly overweight, but I was never active or in shape and my hand-eye coordination is good only in as much as a mouse and keyboard is involved. If you asked me or my family you would have just said I was ""never into all that active stuff"".

​

In 2018, my life goal has been to change all that, because I didn't think it was true - just circumstantial. Earlier this year I trained for a 10K and started heavy weight lifting - hating the former but expanding the latter to 5 days a week. I've gone out hiking, kayaking, and I bike almost every day. In May, I started rock climbing, and fell in love. As of today I'm in the best shape of my life, I feel strong and capable in ways I didn't know possible (but with many years of gains to be had). I've been extensively reading articles and books on climbing as well as the two reddit climbing forums.

​

Obviously I'm still very very new and there are tons of ""noob gains"" to be had by ""just climbing"" (which I do as often as my body allows, which appears to be more and more). But I can tell I'm being hugely held back by two things: lack of trust in my body to perform and lack of mind-body connection, and I would like some advice on how to improve these things, especially from people who have overcome them.

​

I'm very cerebral and in my thoughts a lot (also have moderate-to-severe ADD). Awareness of where my body is in space and what it's doing is usually very low, and I am currently putting most of my training effort into watching/focusing on my body parts (feet, core) to make sure they're doing what I want them to do. In my normal life I'm very clumsy and bump into things, trip, and knock things over all the time. I suck at throwing/catching things and am just generally ungraceful.

​

More importantly, I just don't trust my body. I am often observing these minute hesitations in my daily life for things that I assume I can't do, and I have to remind myself to at least give it a try (ex: lifting my weight to climb on top of something, picking up a heavy thing, leveraging something that is stuck). In climbing, I frequently notice that I won't instinctively try to stand up on a hold because I don't think my legs can do it. I SUCK at reaching holds that require a big push into a grab because the confidence isn't there, and I do a wimpy attempt and peel off after hanging around below the hold for several seconds agonizing about how I won't be able to do it. Logically, I know I \*could\* do it. But I'm always pre-convincing myself that I can't. I'm reading The Rock Warrior's Way now and I feel like I'm doing basically the opposite of everything he recommends. I set myself up for failure by looking at things without objective framing and without confidence. I see everything as being too hard, too scary, above my level.

​

How can I unlearn a lifetime (30 years) of believing I'm weak and incapable? Do you have any advice for how you developed confidence or equanimity in a rock climbing setting, especially for formerly lazy uncoordinated gumbies?",climbing

108,"Any training tips for an older, not very strong but lean person new to climbing?","I work at a climbing gym and have taught beginner lessons and coached kids climbing teams for a little over two years now. I’ve also read numerous books on training and done training programs myself. However, recently I taught a private lesson for a person that I just described in the title, and it’s a little difficult for me because he is not able to do the same exercises that kids or young adults are typically able to do at a beginner level. So far I’ve had him do pull-ups using an assisted pull-up machine(taking off a lot of weight), and done some relatively easy core-work like knee raises because he can’t do sit ups or Russian twists or anything like that.  He knows a good deal of technique but most of the time he doesn’t have the confidence in himself to try things that I suggest while he’s climbing on the wall, so I think that if his strength is increased he will have more confidence in himself while climbing. The only problem is that the supplemental exercises that I’m used to are too difficult for him. Do you guys know of any exercises he    or other  people like him(maybe overweight people or other older people) can do to build a strong fitness base for climbing? ",climbing

114,The Asian Games are underway. Quals are over.,"I rarely watch plastic climbing comps but I'm stuck indoors, it's hot AF outside, and this was on TV anyway. I caught a bit of the bouldering quals and a good chunk of the lead quals. Speed quals were already over. Because I don't watch plastic comps I'm not aware of any other comp that has adopted the Olympic-style combined format yet. At least for me, this is a good pre-run to see how that format will play itself out on a larger scale. What's weird here is that there is a medal for speed, medal for combined (lead+boulder+speed), and a medal for speed relay (not sure how this even works) but that's just the Asian Games. The Olympics will only have the combined medal.


Here are the [men's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-men-combined/) and [women's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-women-combined/) after quals. The scores are calculated by your rank in each discipline multiplied, with the lowest score winning. We'll have to consider that the level of competition here has huge disparity. That being said, there's a big gap between the podium and those outside. Top 6 made finals. Not surprising to see that the two Japanese and two Korean climbers get four spots, then someone else fairly well-rounded (Au &amp; Lee), and someone who blitzed up the speed wall (Khaibullin &amp; Marlenova, coincidentally both from Kazakhstan). It seems like the way the points are calculated, unless you really shit the bed in lead and boulder, winning speed will get you in the finals. I wasn't sure how I felt about it initially but after seeing the table, I'm okay with a ""discipline winner"" basically getting a spot in the finals. 


Finals are tomorrow and they're starting with speed. No indication on which of lead or boulder will be next but if they follow the quals order then it'll be boulder first. I'd be interested to see how the single day finals will turn out logistically for the climbers. That's a lot of high-intensity, high-stakes climbing to do on your 4th day on.",climbing

If you are new to the sub or new to yoga, WELCOME! There is an immense amount of information available in this sub, and an excellent community of people. 

If you have a question, PLEASE check out the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) and try search before creating a new post. As noted in rule 2, commonly asked questions are removed and directed to the above. 

**The updated version of the 'usual' sticky thread:**

This post is intended as a repository of pertinent info, including updates for new and ongoing issues. For the sake of visibility, we'll try to include links as pertinent.

**Reminders:**

* It's in the sidebar, it's in the rules, it's in the note when you create a new post. *PLEASE utilize search and the FAQ before creating a new post.* Especially around the first of the year, it's not unusual to see 3 versions of the same post in a day, asking questions that are well covered in the sub. If your post is removed because the answers are available there the mod team is not scolding you, we're just letting you know why it was done and reminding you that the answers you seek already exist. And yes, the mod team finds themselves busy doing just that this time of year. 

* /r/yoga is not the place for medical advice. This is always a handy reminder.
* **Addendum to the above** - Yoga philosophy and western medicine are different. There is room for both in this sub. This means that things like subtle bodies and energy (prana) movement and chakras *all have a place here* as well as discussion from a western perspective. There is no demand that anyone agrees with what is presented, but rule 1 applies in these cases- be respectful. 

* Yes, we have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/index) and [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) . (And they're awesome.)
The FAQ and search are the best places to start if you're new to yoga or have questions about styles, equipment, injuries, or resources. Plans in the works include a section for teachers, expansion of the section regarding yoga and other activities, and potentially an additional section for the questions that are common that to add to the FAQ would continue to grow an already large document. More FAQ updates will be coming, but in the meantime, we have continued to leave up questions that haven't been in awhile to keep more up-to-date information available when it exists.

* Yes, they're even available via app and mobile. Yes, really. (The sidebar, too!) It can take a little looking, but we haven't yet found an app without access to the sidebar.

* Reddit's guidelines are still the foundation of how we approach spam in /r/yoga, and bans will continue to be a thing as needed. Need the details? Reddit's guidelines are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

* This sub is not for market research. It's a community. Requests for the sub to tell you what we love or hate about our yoga mats and t-shirts will be removed, as will asking us to fill out surveys for that or your thesis research. Those are not the only such examples. When in doubt, feel free to message the mods ahead of time. Established community members can message mods ahead of time for permission on a case-by-case basis. 


**Other notes:**

* The automoderator is in use and working relatively well in terms of catching spam, and the mod team continues to monitor what is being automatically removed. Sometimes we catch them in the first 5 minutes, but sometimes it's a few hours between mod sweeps. If you've posted something that isn't showing up, you're welcome to message the mods (keeping in mind that it's possible it will be a bit before a mod sees it- please be patient!) and ask about it- including a link is much appreciated.

* Your mod team is human (you totally thought we were unicorns and rainbow-chasing leprechauns, but aside from cosplay and Halloween, not so much). Part of modding is making judgement calls, and sometimes we remove things that we can't be sure there isn't a bot behind that turns out to be totally legit because another real, in-the-flesh reddit user actually did post. :) Much like the point above, feel free to ask.

* The discussions on the Sutras have been collected on a wiki page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/sutras). Feel free to continue contributing to those threads as well as the current one. 

* As with the last update, COMP remains as-is. The mod team is done rehashing this topic, which will likely result in the posts questioning COMP that inevitably happen every time someone new finds them questionable being removed and referred to [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/search?q=COMP+self%3Ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;count=25&amp;after=t3_39saiq), until/unless the overall focus in the sub shifts substantially. For those unaware and interested, /u/BeyondMars posted [the following](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/48aaq2/should_an_individual_moderator_make_decisions/d0i424h) last time it came up to get everyone up to speed- here's the section on rule 4, to which I added the link:

&gt;&gt;&gt;   Search the history of this sub for discussions on [COMP] poses. [Probably two years ago now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1i9x4s/mod_post_state_of_the_subreddit_reminders_selfies/) There is a VERY LARGE part of this sub that doesnt wan't them to have a place here at all. The gist of it is that people come to reddit and dont want it to be like another yoga instagram, or something, I dont know. But there were portions of time in this sub when our ENTIRE front page was yoga pics. COMP was an effort to a compromise that would allow people to filter them out if they didnt want them there... In regards to the self-doxxing aspect. Sexual harassment, and online bullying have originated in this sub at least four times that I was made aware of. This rule was instituted to keep everyone safe. I don't care if YOU want your instagram accounts on the sub (self promotion?) but we are keeping people safer with this rule and the way we enforce it. Its going to stay. Take the extra 2 minutes and upload it to imgur.

28 June addition: 

It seemed obvious to the mod team when it was discussed a week or so ago, but for the sake of clarity, it's being noted here as well and will continue to be enforced, *especially* on COMP posts:

**Sexual/sexualized/objectifying comments are not welcome here. Removals are guaranteed, and warning vs. ban will be handled on a case-by-case basis.** 

Just don't. It all falls under rule 1.

136,Found my way back to yoga last night,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share some thoughts I had last night.  

I started practicing yoga in March of this year by following YWA's videos on YouTube. I started with her Revolution series and then went into True. Loved both of those! My shoulder hurt a little bit one day, so I decided to ease up on practicing every day. Well, I quickly fell out of practicing at all. The shoulder pain went away after a day or two but I just couldn't get back into it. At the same time, I was also going through a rough patch in my life. I knew yoga would help because I had been feeling so good while doing it but I was just feeling discouraged about a lot of things in life. Even though the shoulder pain went away I felt like what's the point of getting back into it if I'm just going to have to stop again if my shoulder starts hurting?  

I got into yoga in the first place because of lower back pain from sitting at a desk all day and this pain has returned since I stopped practicing yoga. So two nights ago I decided to start being more consistent (I had started Yoga Camp but hadn't gotten far). Last night I did Day 8 and it was exactly what I needed. The whole sequence was on the floor and a lot on the back (plus she said to grab a pillow, I love when yoga involves a pillow!) I loved it so much I found another random yoga for back video and followed that one too for a full hour of relaxing, peaceful, back healing yoga. It was the first time in a while I didn't care how long the video would be or how much time I'd have left before I had to go to sleep. I was just focused on helping my back to feel better.  

I think I'm going to focus on mostly restorative and gentle yoga for now, since that's what my body seems to like most. I'm only in my late 20s so it's kind of depressing to me to think I can't do the level of physical activity I want to do, but I know that's only temporary. I need to be kind to myself, take it easy, and listen to what my body is telling me. If my shoulder starts hurting again I'm going to go get it checked out. I hate setting up appointments with doctors or for anything really but I know it's important to take care of myself. I imagine a world where I'm not in pain and have the energy to do what I really want to do in life. I can get there but I need to give myself a helping hand.",yoga
137,Postnatal yoga advice?,"Hello! I’m cleared from my doctor and would like to slowly get back into my yoga routine. I’ve been doing simple salutations most days but need a longer flow sequence now. I would like to use online resources since leaving the house with my little guy is nearly impossible right now.

What is the best way to ease back in? I started slacking off around third trimester and am 2 months post partum now, so it’s been almost 5 months since I’ve really been practicing.

I’ve done yoga with Adriene and fightmaster yoga in the past. I feel like fightmaster is too fast and hard right now but ywa doesn’t quite do it for me. I dislike her chatter and really just need someone to help lead a guided flow.

I’ve tried some free flow but I think since I’m so out of practice right now I need a little guidance, plus I always resort to the same few poses and like the suggestions of things I don’t think to go to.

I guess I’m looking for suggestions for online classes/instructors and also any advice to get back into practice. I find it hard to get a long flow in (I’m usually interrupted within 20 minutes) so that has been frustrating. I keep telling myself any yoga is good. 

I’m really struggling with my body post partum. I feel so weak and everything is so tight. I would like to gain some strength and flexibility back so I can begin to feel more like myself again.",yoga

139,Extremely Tight Hip Flexors Causing Knee Pain,"Hi everyone!  
For some background- I'm a 27 year old yogi who's been practicing around 6 days a week for the past 3 years. Generally, I've always been very flexible and have had extremely open hips and loose hip flexors if anything. For example, lowering  hips down all the way in pigeon was a breeze, able to do splits, could sink deep in low lunge and it felt good.

A couple weeks ago I took 3 classes lead by a well known but tough yogi. I definitely pushed myself with a lot of strengthening core/hip flexor stuff but didn't feel any pain at the time. I did notice in the cool down of one class I could barely get into pigeon let alone sink all the way down because the contracted leg's hip flexor was SO tight.   


For a week after this I would try to practice regularly and I noticed both hip flexors were super tight and I was starting to feel pain in the outer edge of one of my knees at the same time. I've had sensitive knees in the past in certain poses but knew to back off and it would go away within a day or two... But this pain in one of my knees and tightness in both of my hip flexors could be felt when I was walking even not doing yoga.  


So I took a week break from yoga thinking that would help and I stopped noticed it while I was walking.. But coming back to yoga, now it's same thing. I'm trying to focus on stretching them out.. But still most open hip poses such as frog, seated wide leg forward fold, malasana, childs pose, happy baby I feel impossible tightness my hip flexors and some I feel the knee pain (I thought stretching it out would help?). Any closed hip flexor lengthening poses like low lunge and high lunge I feel the same.. This is even worse cause it's started to effect my low back as I'm arching it to compensate. Pigeon is a problem in the flexors of both legs as well.  


I have no idea really what happened or what I should do now. Is there something I should be stretching or strengthening that I'm not doing?   


If anyone has any experience with this or advice it would be so nice. I'm feeling a bit frustrated as a daily practitioner not being able to do stuff that used to feel good and easy in my body. Although I will say as a positive, it's going to help me grow as a teacher. :)  


Thanks for any help and sorry for the length!

1. Is going just once a week enough to see progress? I know I should try to go more, but i don’t really have much time unfortunately. I might find some online videos and try to do it another time a week on my own. 

2. Downward dog sucks. I have so much trouble. I’m just not flexible enough to do it right, so I’ve been doing some research on different modifications. Is the best way to just bend the legs and lift heals off the ground and make sure to keep the spine and arms aligned? 

3. Another thing regarding that, they do this thing where they lift the heals and go from toes then heal back on ground when in downward dog. Even with my knees bent I can’t really get my heel to the ground, should I just kind of pretty pressure back into my heel as much as I can, then back into toes?

4. Another thing was we did fallen triangle (I think that’s what she called it), and my arm was shaking a lot along with a few other poses. Is this a balance or a strength thing, so I know which I need to work on focus on to make it smoother and more comfortable. How long do you think it’ll take to be more... solid in this positions. 

5. Breathing. I always feel like I’m breathing wrong or out of synch with the movements she’s doing / the class. Is it okay if I do some transitions a little slower or faster?

This gentleman seemed mindful enough to stagger the mat as best he could with respect to those behind whilst not encroaching upon his neighbor. This woman in the back row got up and started spiking blocks left and right going on about poor yoga etiquette. Started huffing and puffing and loudly slapping her mat on the ground to show her agitation with the heinous act. Do people in the back have a divine right to the mirror if they got there first?

151,Trying to get into yoga but I can't even do beginner stuff,"Hello. I'm a 23 years old male ( 188cm/86kg ^^6'2""/190lb ), and I haven't done exercise for most of my life. I have mild scoliosis and I've suffered from back pain for a long time already. Lately I've been trying to make an effort to improve my health. I've tried to minimize my sitting time and improve my posture, been running regularly for a month, and yesterday I started Yoga with Adriene's 30 Days of Yoga series.

I could barely do most of the stuff for the first day, but I sticked to the end. I figured even if I half-assed most of the posses, I was still doing something and I'd eventually be able to do them properly, but today I had to stop half-way the 2nd day video because I couldn't do anything at all and I was feeling like I was about to collapse. i.e I can't plant my feet when doing Downward Facing Dog, and when doing the Half Forward Bend I can't get my hands to the floor without bending my knees and I worry that I'm rounding my back too much.

[Then, I decided to do a quick reddit search, and it seems like the consensus between xxfitness is that her routines are too easy](https://np.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/5ee7j0/does_anyone_do_the_yoga_with_adriene_videos/). Needless to say, I'm feeling really unmotivated.

My main objective is to fix my posture, gain more flexibility and learn how to not round my back and do simple things like squat properly. My end goal is to have a good foundation for doing compound lifts, as I've always been interested in powerlifting, but I'm not able to do the most basic stuff with weights so I figured I should improve my body awareness and flexibility without weights first.

I'm thinking that I might just have a mental block rather than physically not being able to do those poses correctly, but I've been sitting most of my life so I think I'm just way too stiff.

I have been into meditation for a few years and have always known about Yoga and heard how good it was for you both mentally and physically.

2 weeks ago I went and signed up for a monthly membership at a local studio and since then have gone pretty much every day (11 times exactly) and have loved every part of it.

My point for making this post is that if you have been thinking about trying a yoga class but still haven't made it in...just go.  I'm a guy and was anxious about going the first time but once there I felt at home because everyone was so nice and welcoming.

I know classes may not be for everyone or maybe not in the budget right now but if you have been wondering and can fit it in the budget I think you'll really enjoy it if you just give it a try.

Alternatively if you like to keep your practice at home, keep doing you...no judgement here.

THIS ENTIRE TIME I wasn't actually doing down dog like my form wasn't there at all. Heck, I didn't even have the proper form for child's pose lol! Another thing - props, such a game changer. Also, there are so many freaking styles of yoga that I had no idea about, and its been so fun to explore them all (my favorite is iyengar because...inversions). And the best part are the instructors. They're so hands on and go around fixing people's forms and advising them on what they can improve on.

162,New to yoga &amp; wary of effects on spine/lower back (no pre-existing injuries),"Hi yogis.  I'd like someone to explain the rationale for certain yoga poses/movements for me, and I hope my wariness won't be taken the wrong way.  My partner, who is doing a PhD in spinal health (and has a degree in exercise physiology, and has been a gym instructor for over 10 years), has made me hypervigilant about protecting my back during any kind of exercise.  Basically he tells me that too much spinal extension is terrible, and that you should never twist laterally when in spinal flexion.  I've noticed several poses or transitions involve a fair degree of exactly this - spinal extension (e.g. cobra, upward facing dog, back bends - obviously) or twisting while in flexion.  Last night I did a class where we were encouraged to lie supine over a (quite large) bolster to 'protect the spine', which put us into pretty significant extension.  My partner was horrified when I demonstrated all this for him!!  So my question is:

\- have I gotten this completely wrong and we *shouldn't* be doing these kinds of movements in yoga?

\- is my partner just overly conservative and risk-averse (highly likely)?

\- if these things are really a part of yoga, how are such 'dangerous' movements justified, and how do you avoid injuries while performing them?

3. If I did the same 3 or 4 poses every day, would that be good? Or would I need to do something different each day?

This has been my lifestyle choice for years, so it is no stretch for me to assure you that I won't blame you if your help or advice does not work or even if it makes me worse.  And my questions are very general.                 

I had a slightly collapsed disk with herniation and inflammation about 6 years ago or so.  It hurt like hell.  I had to scoot around the grocery store in those scooters for old and crippled people.  I was about 66 years old at that time.  I said at the time that I was going to heal myself.  I did.  I healed the inflamed part and the herniation part with many practices all piled together, including eating an anti-inflammatory diet.                

But now the collapsed disk is beginning to hurt and be inflamed.  It is nothing like what I went through 6 years ago.  That pain basically saved my life by forcing me to get hardcore about diet and exercise and health in general.                  

Now I am looking to yoga (and other things) to help with the collapsed disk.  I am fully aware that this time, being almost 73, I may not be able to heal it.  But I am going to try because it is my responsibility to try, for the sake of my family and for my sake.  This is my plan:

I was thinking about just doing stair laps, a basic core workout, and working out my triceps. How does this sound should I add anything else?

Are there other climbers that workout on their offdays? If so could you please share your workout schedule?

203,One injury leading to another?,"After having some muscle spasms in my traps due to overtraining, I went to my doctor. I also had some tightness in my chest muscles. This seemed to be causing some thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms. She said to hold back on the harder sports I was involved in but keep stretching and doing yoga. My traps are slowly getting better.

But, in trying to correct my posture, I seem to have irritated some other muscles in my upper back, shoulders and glutes. I switched to a standing desk and now I'm getting some tightness in my glutes and some sciatic nerve compression symptoms in my legs that comes and goes (calves and shins get cold and tingly). Also, my left forearm is now cramping and is also cold and tingly.

2 weeks ago, she said to come and see her in 4-6 weeks if I wasn't any better. I'm on the verge of going back next week. My symptoms are much better on the weekends when I'm not working at my desk job all day.

Gave yoga a go to stretch out my legs and core to help with recovery and prevent injury. So far I’ve seen massive improvements. I hurt less after running,  I cycle faster and I just feel a lot looser. And then there’s the added benefit of the endorphin high which is much greater from just a short amount of stretching over what I’d normally get after a long run/cycle. 

When I do camel pose I keep getting cramp in my lats. I can prevent it by not breathing so deeply. The muscle is quite relaxed (or not being stretched at least) so I’m not sure what’s going on. 

I’m guessing either my form is off, although I’ve recorded myself doing it and it looks more or less ok, or my lats need strengthening. Maybe they’re tensing up to try and keep my body stable.

Anyone got any advice on what is best to do to fix this? Should I just keep at it and hopefully be able to hold it longer without cramp? Or should I  work on back strength?

248,I need some guidance to choose a style,"First and foremost, hello and thanks you for taking some time to read me and help me.

So I’ve been doing yoga on/off for more than a year, it then became what i did during active recovery days. But I went through what I would call a “training crisis”. I didn’t know why I was weight lifting, why I was running or why I was doing calisthenics. I felt like it was wrong, that it wasn’t really me. I mean, I did enjoy sport and physical activity, but I had done these things over and over for more than 3 years, and my practice did not evolve as much as I did. Eventually, I did stopped doing everything except yoga, which was the only thing I still enjoyed, and it was in line with my goals.

So I started doing Yoga nearly everyday, sometimes twice a day thanks to the downdog app, it felt great, I felt great afterward, everything was fine. But I tried to deepen my practice, I knew a bit about yoga styles, but not much, so I tried to learn more about most styles. Two styles in particular pleased me:

* **Vinyasa:** what I started with, and what I still enjoy a lot. I love the fact that the class is really flowing, each movement leading to the next one really is something I enjoy. Overall I felt great, improved quite a bit and thought I was getting a good workout overall

* **Ashtanga:** ashtanga is amazing in principles, I love the fact that it is rooted in yogic principles; that it follows a tradition, I love doing Surya Namaskar A and B plus the fundamentals postures, I love this moving meditation and I love the community. However, I really don’t like the series. I mean it doesn’t seem to be a balanced at all (but I may be missing a point). On the top of that, I feel like apart from the Surya Namaskar, ashtanga isn’t flowing that much for a Vinyasa style, and isn't way more flexibility focused than what people say.

So here is my problem: I can’t decide which style I should focus on. I really like the physical aspect of Vinyasa, and I really like the philosophy of Ashtanga, but I don’t seem to be able to ally both. What do you think I should do?

(while re reading the post it seems like some ashtangis could think I'm attacking them and their favourite yoga style, which believe me isn't my intention at all, I actually love your style and find most ashtangis really inspiring)

EDIT: I understand too that Ashtanga isn't supposed to be a workout but a moving meditation, it's just that I'd like both.",yoga

257,New Shoulder Issue in Down Dog,"I'm new to this sub--hoping one of you fine people can give me more answers than my yoga instructors.

I've been practicing yoga for about 6 years on and off but got much more serious about it in the last year and a half.  Downward dog has always been one of my favorite postures as far as a feeling of balance and well-being, that is up until about 6 months ago.  Something in my left shoulder seems to be blocking my arm from achieving the proper external rotation.  You know how when you rotate externally and pull your shoulders away from your ears, it gives a sensation almost like you can feel your joints going deeper into themselves? Well on the left side it's like it gets painfully stuck and unable to go as deep.  Pain runs right along the top of my shoulder.  I don't feel it in forearm balances or dolphin pose, or even in plank.  Only in downward dog and sometimes in triangle.  It's highly frustrating as the pose now makes me feel lopsided and stuck whereas before it was a place of engagement and relaxation to return to in my practice.  I spoke to my yoga instructor about it and she brushed it off, saying I probably just had a little asymmetry in my body (not true, didn't have it before!), and that I appeared to be doing the posture properly and well.  Any insights into what might be going on and what I could do to remedy it?

261,A birthday gift for a yoga instructor / girlfriend,"I appologise if I'm trespassing with a silly question.

I was recently introduced to yoga by my new girlfriend who happens to be a certified yoga instructor. Her birthday is coming up very soon and since yoga is a huge part of her life I figured it would be nice to get her something related. As a complete beginner I'm afraid to get a tacky or useless thing. 

She teaches / practices at two different places and at home. I'm concidering getting her a watercolor yoga mat (http://dvayoga.ru/d/860821/d/akvarel_yogamat.jpg). Perhaps 4mm version. Maybe with a different picture. Is it a good idea or is it tacky and unprofessional to have a painted mat? 

I also have other options... One is a bonsai tree, but she has a cat which will probably destroy it at once. 

Please let me know if there's something you'd love to receive as a gift. Something with meaning. A fun activity for the day is organised, but I'd like to get something lasting too. 

I realise it's not exactly a yoga question, but I'm sure almost everyone here has a yoga instructor, so it might be a useful discussion. Thanks everyone. ",yoga

266,Side crow question,"Hi all! I have a question about side crow. I’ve tried to figure it out via Google but I keep coming up with mixed answers. Hopefully someone can help. 

I’m really just wondering if your legs are meant to be resting ONLY on one arm, or if they can rest along both triceps. 

In a recent class I took, the instructor had us place our legs along both triceps, (of course with both knees pointing in one direction). But today, a different instructor had us balance our legs on one arm, leaving no part of our body touching the other arm. Does anyone know what the proper way of doing this pose is? ",yoga
267,Trying to pinpoint hip mobility problem,"What a great sub! I’ve been practicing various forms of yoga for years and am interested now in improving poses by understanding the mechanics of my body better. My biggest issue is a specific tightness of my hips in one direction - they don’t want to rotate in any way that lifts my leg up and to the side. This is most noticeable in frog pose - if I keep my knees bent only 90deg and my feet flexed, I can barely open my knees as wide as my mat before they just seem to stop. I can sometimes breathe and move slowly back and forth enough to settle a couple inches wider, but this has not improved much over many years of practice. I have decent internal/external rotation otherwise, but tight hip flexors and poor glute activation  that I am working a lot on. 

Any ideas on what I can work on to open my groin/hips/whatever is going on more?  ",yoga
268,How to feel about teacher being repeatedly late?,"Hi everyone!
So my absolute favorite yoga teacher - who is always amazing and whose style really suits me - is almost always 5 to 10 minutes late for class, and I don't know how to feel about it. On the one hand I know that Ivm always calm and satisfied at the end of her classes, regardless of their length, and since she is such a good teacher I won't stop going to her classes anyway. On the other hand it feels a bit disrespectful on her part and I can't help feeling irritated about it at times, which isn't a very nice starting point for a class. I have been thinking about notifying the studio about the issue so they maybe can speak to her and/or make adjustments to her working schedule as to give her more time between classes. I don't however want to risk them sacking her or her being offended /fed up and deciding to quit. She seems very genuine and present when she is teaching, but I also do pay good money for the classes and it feels a little bit like I'm systematically not given my money's worth... 

Any suggestions on how to go about changing this situation? Or should I just work on myself and my own reactions to it?",yoga
269,Recently experiencing intense energy while doing heart opening stretch. Normal?,"I don't actually do yoga but am not sure where else to ask this question. I felt what I experience as some energy stuckness in my chest and stomach and recently began giving it a good stretch. I spread my arms out wide, arch my back, and push my chest and stomach out until it feels a little uncomfortable and then hold my breath at the top of the stretch for 3-5 seconds before exhaling and returning to my normal posture. During of after the exhale I often experience a disorienting, but mostly pleasant, feeling that is difficult to describe. It feels like an energy release that puts me very much in my body and my thoughts often completely stop altogether for up to a minute. At it's most intense I lose awareness of my environment for a few seconds. The experience can be quite intense sometimes and I have to make sure that I am near a place where I can sit or lay down when I do this now because I'm afraid it might make me fall over.

I had a motorcycle accident 19 years ago which left me with an incomplete quadriplegia. The vertebrae healed with the aid of a halo vest so I have no metal in my neck or restrictions in terms of movement. This had however affected my upper and lower limbs, particularly my left hand side a well as bladder, etc. Movement is possible but with walking aids and very short distances, and I use a wheelchair which someone else has to push dude to limited upper body strength.

I have always worked, often to the detriment of my physical health and would like to improve my mobility specially now that I have become a father. Having tried loads of different things, loads of physio, I attend the gym 3 to 4 times per week where someone helps me, I feel I have run out of options. Due to my lack of movement I keep putting on weight (3 stone/20kgs/40+lbs) this year alone.

There has been a video circulating online for a few years with an ex parachuter who recovers in 6 months using yoga. I have contacted numerous yoga instructors here in Norfolk, in the UK &amp; those who have responded say that an assessment alone will cost me £90 to £100 but that they do not know if they can help. I always thought that yoga was about helping rather than financial benefit. I am happy to pay &amp; an aware that I won't walk unaided our run again but at the same time don't really see anyone keen on taking on the challenge.

288,Yoga cured my back pain,"I have had lower back pain for about a year now. It always feels worse after work because I’m on my feet all day, or the week before and during my period. It was bad enough pain that I was taking over the counter pain meds daily and had begun considering seeing a doctor or chiropractor for help .
Well, a few weeks ago I started doing daily YouTube yoga. I didn’t even start to help with pain, but to help with anxiety and as a fun exercise routine. I very quickly realized how good it felt to stretch out all the tightness in my body. It also felt sooo great on my back.
Within 4 days I noticed a huge difference in my back pain. I wasn’t complaining to my bf as often or asking him to rub it, and I no longer felt the need to take the pain meds.
3 weeks later, and I almost never feel pain in my back. The exception being for a few days during my period. I had had people suggest so many different things, and knew people had said yoga helped with this. But I had no idea just how much of a difference it would make!! So thankful for this practice and highly recommend to try it if you’re looking for something fun that feels great for your bod!!",yoga

I'm a huge proponent of having a solid understanding of the fundamentals in any practice, and yoga is no different, but I can't help but wonder if things like inversions will be something that I naturally progress to, or if it's something that people need to cross train for in order to achieve. If it's the former, I'll just continue on my path, be patient, and know that I'll get there in time. If it's the latter, then perhaps I can supplement my practice with other work. 

So to those out there who can flip upside-down at a moment's notice; did this come as a result of practicing yoga for years, or was it something you achieved only after putting in specific work to make it happen?

My question is: Are there supplemental exercises I should be doing to help with strengthening? One teacher has recommend climbing which I can access but would find it difficult to fit into my weekly schedule if I'm honest. Would lifting small weights at a gym help me build some strength or do I just accept defeat and admit my body will never be fit enough to keep up with a vinyasa flow?

308,Lotus posture and knee osteoarthritis,"A few month ago I saw my doctor due to knee pain and found I have a first light form of wear and tear induced osteoarthritis. With a week on medication the pain went away and with adjustments in exercise it does rarely come back.

Two weeks ago I went on a meditation retreat with 8 hours of sitting a day (and walks in between). On day 4 I noticed that the pain in my knees does not go away after getting off the cushion so I switched to a chair and it went OK subsequently. I used both a seiza bench and cushion for Burmese posture, so maybe one posture triggers it and the other does not, but as I sat in both positions I can not tell. In my two 1 hour sits that I do daily I use the bench and don't have any problems, but I guess that is also too little sitting to trigger it, as compared to the 8 hours on retreat.

Does anyone here have osteoarthritis in the knees, and if so, what is the best sitting posture (I know, chair is always an option)?

I read that most ""normal"" knee pain in lotus postures comes from immobile hip joints and overstressing the knees by bending them sideways. But if I mobilize my hips (gently and with due time of course), do you reckon I could get to a quarter/half/full lotus that does not stress my knees?

Background: The hot power yoga studio I attend offers modifications for most poses to make the pose more accessible or more challenging depending on individual preference. However, I can only make it to the studio once or maybe twice on the weekend because of needing child care. I can take yoga at the gym more often during the week because child care is available, but the classes at the gym tend to be really basic. I know there is plenty of growth to be had from working through basic postures, focusing on the breath, etc- but I still want to grow my practice and explore more intermediate/advanced poses. 

For example, if we’re doing sun salutations and the instructor is prompting knees down/baby cobra and breaking up the flow, would it be ok to move through chaturanga/up dog? Or if we’re doing a wide leg forward fold, moving into headstand? Just thinking of options that are offered in the studio. Is it acceptable to move into more challenging variations even if they’re not specifically offered?

I used to do yoga regularly and I really loved the practice, but a few years ago I developed a debilitating chronic illness that destroyed most of my functionality and I stopped all exercise, including yoga.

I am trying to get back into exercise (with support from my doctors) but I have a very low tolerance for exertion.  I have tried to get back into yoga, because I really loved doing it, but I'm finding that the *mental* effort of yoga (the focus on the breath, the awareness of the body, and trying to be conscious in every moment) is causing me significant issues and I have yet to finish even a 20 min practice.

So now I'm kind of stuck.  So far the only exercise I seem to be able to stick with is walking, which is fine, but I want to get back to my *life* which has included yoga since college (20 years ago).

Anyone have any suggestions for reducing the mental effort of yoga?  A different type?  I have done Kundalini, Vinyasa, and Bikram in the past but not since I got sick, I've tried to just focus on ""beginner yoga"" videos on YouTube.  I really believe those forms would be WAY to hard for me.

Every time I do yin, whether in a group class or with a video, I get really powerful discomfort, edging into a kind of coursing pain in a horizontal line across my low back at the end of class -- while doing corpse pose. It makes me immediately want to take a counterpose. I had a teacher for an intensive course who would say to not draw the knees up and to stay with the sensation, but it feels like something's wrong and is immediately relieved by coming out of corpse pose. As far as I know I never push the poses past the ""edge""; I'm very conservative. Just wondering if anyone knows why a yin practice would cause such an intense low back response in corpse pose? I do have a hypomobile SI joint (right side) in case that's useful information...thanks for any thoughts!",yoga

325,Yoga deflation,"Hi guys, wondering and praying someone has experience or guidance...
I've been practicing yoga for around 18 months now and have always been left feeling rejuvenated after each session, I was doing an hours class each week and about 4 or 5 months ago subscribed to Yogaglo and practice at least every other day, however, over the last 3 or 4 weeks if I do any longer than 30 minutes 45 minutes max I start feeling incredibly unwell, fairness, dizziness, strong nausea and get very cold and shakey... any ideas? 
Not sure it's of any help but I'm 5ft 10 and 9st, my yoga tutor thinks it's due to low blood pressure but mines usually high. 
Its really getting me down, feeling like I'm not able to push myself at all, and not getting the rejuvenation from yoga....

326,Why buddha?,"I am both a yoga practitioner and a buddhist meditation practioner, and i find one thing very strange in western Yoga studios: lots of zen and buddha with NO hindu. I am confused by this; all yoga studios i have been to have statues of buddha, and are marketed as zen and inner peace yet i never see krishna, vishnu, brahma  or any other hindu deity? Is buddhism or zen much more marketable and palatable than Hinduism? I feel like you can easily slip buddha and zen stuff in without it feeling like religion and that is harder to do with Hindu. Most Yoga is rooted in Hinduism but western minds are scared of it and business owners aka studio owners decorate to make their customers feel good and choose zen over hindu.

327,Lower back soreness or pain?,"So I started my yoga journey one week ago by attending a hot yoga class. I've been doing a little bit of yoga everyday with my partner following some YouTube videos for beginners. I noticed today that my lower back (almost extending towards/to my tailbone) is achey. I can't tell if it is just soreness from stretching or overexertion. I registered and paid for a hot toga class tomorrow night. Should I still go? Or go and take it very slow? I feel like I need to stretch myself out some but don't want to cause an injury. 

My stamina and flexibility aren't good at all and I want to challenge myself but I thought I was doing a good job at practicing safely and not pushing too hard.

328,How to learn poses in a class?,"I'm fairly new to yoga, having only practiced several times throughout the years. I've recently taken a more serious interest in yoga and have been attending classes. 

I took a CPY class (C1 and C2) where the instructor led us into crow pose, explaining the different steps on how to approach it. It all makes sense as she's explaining, but once I start out on my own, I feel completely lost. I see others around me who have perfected it and others who are getting the hang of it--I understand that I am new and that yoga, like all things, require practice and consistency. However, my concern is that I'm not really making progress because I'm 1) lost and 2) not getting personalized attention to push me out of my comfort zone (it feels kinda scary, man).

I  do have a desire to achieve that goal but how do I go about doing it? What's worked for you? ",yoga

332,Are banana hammocks acceptable in studio classes?,"Legit question. I just got out of a Vinyasa II class that I typically take and this was a dude’s first time. This is a smaller studio, but not super free-ashram-naked-people-everywhere. It’s in a major city and almost everyone that attends is young to middle aged professionals after work. You’ll get the shirtless dudes with running shorts or ladies in shorts and a sports bra when it’s hot, but this was on another level. 

It was a full class of women and a couple guys and I was so distracted by his thong (despite trying desperately to meditate and overcome) that I just didn’t have a great class. 

If it had been tiny little shorts whatever but a full on thong. A couple other people were side-eye-ing and my sweet 20something instructor didn’t really know what to do. 

Do I email the manager? What’s the protocol here? Do I just need to get over it? What would you do?

335,My first yoga injury (but it's not all bad!),"I've been working on my middle splits as a personal goal.  A couple weeks in, I noticed my bad knee was feeling progressively tweaky.  It started out as a ""this is probably stretching pain"" and turned into ""yeah this doesn't feel right at all"".  The sensations started happening in lunges and warriors too.  

What I did next was completely radical for me:  I let go of my goal.  I stopped doing the daily exercises.  I made adjustments in other asanas to protect my knee.  I accepted the fact that my body may not be capable of middle splits (at this time, or possibly ever).  And that's ok.  

Before yoga, I would have never let ""a little pain"" stop me.  I still have a long way to go towards applying these principles in other areas of my life, but at least this is a step.  Just feeling grateful for this mental gift.          ",yoga

339,Yoga lessons in India based on donation or work for being taught,"Hello, I am going to India in September, will be staying around 2 months and would like to try learn some yoga.

My background: I am a 24 year old man.
 I have been doing some yoga on and off, mostly sporadically for the last 4 years. The problem is that I have always had different teachers who have taught different styles. It has made me very confused because one teacher says: "" do this"" and the other ""do that"". Sometimes the statements contradict each other.
Therefore I would like to find a good teacher who is passionate about yoga and can teach me some solid basics and rotations that will be a good foundation to develop from. 
I like the energetic aspects of ashtanga but also simplicity of hatha. Some day, being able to stand on my hands would be incredible.
Incorporating elements such as mantras is also welcome but not necessary.

I am not picky, just looking for a true genuine teacher who will gladly teach me. I also practice vipassana meditation around 1-2 hours daily which I have heard is possible to do in combination with yoga.

If you know any good teachers, ashrams or other places to look I would be very grateful.

342,Teaching to Varied Mobility Levels,"Hey yogis!

200 hour RYT with a few years of teaching experience here looking for advice. I'm teaching a class with very widely varying levels of mobility. It's not just a mixed level class (beginner, intermediate, advanced), I'm talking folks with regular practices alongside folks who have serious difficulty moving from seated to standing and vice versa.

My approach thus far has been:

* offering tons of props (including chairs)
* providing A/B/C options for most poses (A being very supported or seated, B being what many might consider standard, and C being more challenging)
* tending toward a more restorative practice so that everyone can reap the benefits of support and no one is rushed into or out of poses

But it still feels like teaching two separate classes simultaneously. Any tips?

ETA:

I'm of course teaching primarily to those who have mobility problems and may need some additional support to avoid discomfort and injury. I think it's wonderful that such a wide variety of students come to practice, and I want to meet them where they are. I know that the more advanced practitioners can more or less lead themselves, but I want to make sure they don't feel neglected as well. ",yoga
343,Does Anyone Get Strange Stares Every Time They're In Class,"Ever since I started my journey into Yoga I would go to this center that I've been going to for quite a while just for tai chi and I decided to try the yoga classes since the tai chi classes weren't really going on too much. What I noticed was that a lot of the members in the room would just stare at me strangely (I'm the youngest person there and most of the time the only male there) There were points in time where I would sometimes hear the people talk about me or scoff behind my back then when I turn to look at them with my calmest expression then they say nothing. What I then found that was really odd was that I haven't done yoga that long but did a lot of research on it (I'm off and on with it but I do try to read books on it and look things up online)  and have a very huge basic understanding to it. I then see some of the people there and they were practicing for more than a decade but yet didn't know or understand what it was about.

346,[Advice] New to Yoga - Recovering from minor back injury,"tl;dr: back injury, tight hamstrings and yoga newbie. looking for stretching advice

A little background on my situation. About 4 months ago, I hurt my lower back bending to put down two 40-pound dumbbells. MRI showed a minor disk bulge and some edema in the muscles. I went through 4 weeks of physical therapy but my back still doesn't seem right. I just signed up at a hot yoga studio (never been to a yoga class before) to give it a try because I know that stretching is something I need so desperately to get better at. Yesterday was my first class which was a ""Gentle Yoga + Yin."" I thought it went well and I really enjoyed some of the stretches, but the most apparent issue I had was the tightness in my hamstring and hip area. I struggle just holding a seated position with my legs straight. If I lie down, I can get my leg straight up to only about a 45 degree angle or maybe less, before they start shaking. I honestly think this level of tightness is what facilitated the injury in the first place. I'm open to any advice on how to approach getting the hamstring area loose, even if it means simple exercises that I can do at home. My plan right now is to continue going to gentle yoga to get a better feel for the poses, but I just want to make sure I don't further injure myself. ",yoga

355,How common is it to do more than one style of yoga? Have more than one studio membership?,"I'm thinking about how to move ahead with my practice. I like taking classes although I will practice a small amount at home. I don't really feel like I'm doing yoga unless I practice at a studio once or twice a week.

I started practicing yoga at a flow style studio. I really enjoyed that, but certainly felt that it was about the workout first and the deeper practice was secondary. It's still a good school, but the classes were large and the teachers didn't dig too deeply into proper posture - oh, and the music! - some of it ""yoga typical"" - but some of it not. I'd almost forgotten about that. So, I did flow for about two years.

I switched to a more traditional studio and immediately enjoyed it. I liked the emphasis and deep work on specific areas of the body and specific asanas. There's much more meditation. There's no music. Overall, I feel that it's ""righter"" than the flow style. I even remember that the traditional teacher taught ujjayi breathing in a way that made sense that the flow teachers never did in two years! However, the asanas aren't as strenuous, the other students (like me) are older, and so the exercise generally isn't as vigorous. Over time though, I miss the workout and ironically I don't attend the traditional school as much and so actually feel less flexible now.

Have other people been in a similar situation? Do you just go to both studios? Kind of alternate depending on what you're looking for?",yoga

364,Hip alignment questions!,"So, I’ve been taking a yoga class this summer at my college and it has been super informational on how to properly &amp; safely get into poses, but also has helped me really begin my yoga practice (yay!). 
My hips are terribly misaligned after 5-6 years of working in restaurants where I would be on tile floors for 6-8 hours at time, shifting all my weight to my right side. This is very apparent when its harder for me to get into a pose that stretches my right side more than my left (i.e. in pigeon, my extended left leg does not feel nearly as much of stretch as my extended right does). 
SO, after telling my yoga teacher this, she told me we would be doing poses that specifically focus on hips! Of course, an 8 week class for one hour a day may not show significant change in alignment so, what kind of practice could I do every day that mainly pertain to my hips? I really would like to get them aligned as I have back problems as a result. When they are eventually aligned, will I notice slightly wider hips? I have a pretty board-straight figure lol 

Any recommendations would be appreciated!

As the title says, I’m quite out of shape. I did dance classes until I was 15 and after that the only exercise I really get is choreography from the occasional community theatre show plus walking the family dog every now and then. As a result I pretty much feel like garbage all the time and I want to fix that. I am not self motivated *at all* when it comes to exercise (obviously), so I’m hesitant to join a gym because I feel like I’d just never go because I’d be scared to use the equipment wrong and hurt myself or something. I feel like I’d do better in a class setting where someone is directing what I do and it’s scheduled every week so I have to force myself to go. I’m not looking for a weight loss strategy really (gotta fix my diet first and that’s also on the list, but that’s a whole other post), but I would like to feel less like garbage?? I don’t know. 

What I’m wondering is whether just jumping in is a bad idea for someone like me? I don’t want to get overwhelmed or put myself in over my head to the point where I don’t want to go back ever, so should I try to practice yoga at home first to become more familiar with it?

As with most people who work in an office, I suffer with the usual aches and pains but they keep becoming increasingly severe. The doctor recommended that I should take up yoga, or at least practice some certain poses which she kindly printed. This was early last year.

I've got a mat, couple of foam blocks and a strap which came in a really cheap starter pack; I'd like to upgrade the mat in due course but want to justify it with a regular routine. The regular routine is where I'm struggling...

It's often fairly uncomfortable because I don't really own any stretchy clothing, so I'm thinking that a pair of compression shorts may help. I've also found Yoga with Adrienne to be remarkably frustrating because of the constant inane talking; this then makes me want to give up. I genuinely don't have the time to go to a class and as a result I try to do my stretches early morning when I can bring myself to face the slippery mat, annoying video and uncomfortable crotch (I'm male).

Where do I go from here? I've read through the FAQ where there are tonnes of resources, books and courses but I don't know where to start in my situation. I would still class myself as an inflexible newbie, but at least I know what I'm getting myself in for. 

* For the guys: will the compression shorts relieve a lot of frustration?
* Should I start to look for a less slippery mat? I think this was the Diadora starter pack (very thin with little traction on the wood floor).
* Any highly recommended alternatives to Adrianne? ",yoga

387,"Plantar fasciitis and yoga, HELP!","I've been dealing with some pretty painful plantar fasciitis for the past year. I kept practicing yoga regularly throughout thinking it would help, but found after stopping for a few weeks, that stopping  actually sped up my recovery. I don't know if it's something I am doing wrong or what? I pretty much have to wear shoes all the time to recover quickly so I am wondering if it's that. I was hoping some yogis can help me answer a few questions, as I miss yoga dearly  (I used to practice daily for the past 3 years). Have any of you dealt with plantar fasciitis? Did you continue practicing yoga? Is it absolutely offensive to wear shoes when practicing? I am wondering if keeping my shoes on could help me do both. Thank you for all your insights!",yoga
388,Shoutout to yoga for helping me feel like myself again,"So from like 2010-2015 I had a daily practice, mostly in a studio, sweating my butt off with hot Baptiste yoga and feeling on top of the world most days. I wrote long blog posts coming to all these realizations about myself and the world. A challenge presented itself and I would go forth and conquer. I ran a half marathon! I graduated college! I got up the confidence to start  dating and began dating my now fiance! I saw the good and the potential in everything! 

Somewhere along the line, I lost yoga. I made excuses about how yoga isn't just asana, it's meditation too, but I wasn't actually ever meditating. I kept reading about  it, but never actually practicing  I became jaded and bitter pretty quickly. I would avoid spending time on my mat, I think because I was kind of ashamed of how I was acting (brief examples- someone I'm close to at work pointed out that I complain a lot, fiance and I got into a lot of arguments because I would procrastinate basic things like laundry and calling the car repair place). 

Anyway. About 2-3 months ago I realized that this wasn't how I wanted to live my life anymore, especially knowing that just 3 short years ago I was this happy go lucky early 20s chick who was always a little anxious on the inside but also hopeful and optimistic. And surprisingly, it was so easy to get back on my mat once I stopped letting my ego get in the way. It started with 10 minutes in the morning or before bed, and now I'm aiming for an hour 4 days a week with a shorter practice on other days. And I feel like I've made a complete 180- things don't seem as hard or as terrible and don't seem like as big of a deal. In general I get overwhelmed very easily and it's easy to get in my head about to-do lists, money, relationship stuff, whatever, but I feel much more capable of handling everything now. 

Anyway sorry this became a saga but I'm sitting here drinking coffee waiting to go on a run and I'm looking forward to my yoga later so I needed to share. I hope you all can relate :) ",yoga

391,"Young, disabled, and looking to try yoga","Hello,

I am a poly trauma survivor, from a motorcycle accident just under 3 years ago. The extent of my injuries can be summarized in the following photo-album:

[https://imgur.com/a/4TmpZKL](https://imgur.com/a/4TmpZKL)

I have started to take some golf lessons and while it does not cause acute pain in my back, my lower back does get noticeably sore quickly. This worries me and it was recommended to do some yoga as a safeguard. Additionally, the neurosurgeons prior to the surgery told me yoga would likely be the best form of exercise for me long term, so it has been on my should-do list. But I have had little motivation up until now. It's difficult. 

But I am definitely someone born in the iron factory, not the noodle factory (saw that on here before).  Which makes yoga inherently unappealing and I used to get sufficient stretching just from staying active. 

With all that said I do not think I am anywhere near being able to attend a local class. If there is some specific online resource that you could point me to that is meant for people like me that are in horrible shape flexibility-wise but have to be very careful about not injuring themselves, that’d be great. 

I think a goal would be to get to the point where I can feel comfortable attending classes. 

Thanks.",yoga

394,Wow. This made my morning...,"So this morning I woke up at 5:30 AM and decided to double the length of my resistance work out. Usually it's only 30 minutes. A real intense 30 minutes. But I decided to add some sets and make it an hour, right? 

.

After that, I took some L-Theanine (real relaxing amino acid), I laid down, and decided to do yoga nidra. I did it for 30 minutes, and then rolled over to just sort of rest for another 15 minutes. Let me tell you. **It was amazing.**

.

 I got up and I feel incredibly relaxed..*.like I went through a whole day and slept,* and I've got a new day ahead of me. .

Because of the intense work out, yoga nidra brought me into a really deep but aware state, where my body was extremely relaxed, and my mind was revitalized. It really showed me how timing really matters in the effectiveness of certain activities.

I'm a newbie in yoga, I started a couple of months ago doing hot yoga once a week (1h classes) and I love it, but I feel like once a week is not very often and I won't actually improve or get many benefits out of it? For now I can hardly do any balancing or positions that require any muscle strength at all.

403,Advice for opening up the sides of the torso?,"I’ve been doing yoga semi-regularly for over a year now and one of the first things I’ve noticed about my body when I started was how tight and rigid and inflexible the sides of my torso are.  I’m actually super embarrassed that pre-yoga me was lacking so much body awareness that I never even knew my side body was tight.  It honestly never occurred to me.

How tight?  In the beginning I felt an immense amount of tightness and resistance doing even slight side bends.  The yoga videos I’ve watched encouraged me to bring my arms “up and over”, but I couldn’t even bring my arms comfortably all the way up.  They were kind of off to the side.  If I tried to push beyond my comfort zone, I felt pain in my side body, so I took it easy and figured my body would open in time.

My body HAS opened in time... kind of.  I can now get my arms up and slightly over.  Some days I progress, some days I regress.  General progress in this arena has been very very slow.

I’ve done a few different routines I found/bought online.  Pretty much all of the routines focus on alternating between heart openers and hip openers.  I’ve made progress in both.  My hips have opened beyond how I ever imagined it could be (I can do front splits and lotus pose now!)  My shoulders have opened considerably as well, though not as much as my hips.  I can now clasp my hands over my shoulder/behind my back both ways with a firm grip quite comfortably (whereas before I couldn’t even make my hands touch and needed a strap.)  And I’m getting closer to getting my palms to touch in reverse prayer.

Considering how much progress I’ve made in these other areas, I’m feeling frustrated at my snail’s pace progress at opening up my side body.  Confession: I can’t even do side angle pose.  Well, I try, but mine looks nothing like how it’s “supposed” to look.

What am I doing wrong?  Why, after over a year, am I still unable to bring my arms “up and over” like the instructor shows when doing side stretches?  Why can’t I do a proper side angle pose?  What are some poses or stretches I can do to help open up my sides?  Why are they so tight in the first place?  Am I sitting or sleeping wrong?

Tbh I’ve reached a point in my yoga practice where I’m no longer concerned with achieving the “look” of certain poses.  I just want my body to be open and limber and healthy.  Right now, my side body feels so closed still that I think it may be hindering my progress in other ways.  I need help.

404,Any guys here find that doing Yoga attracts a lot of attention?,"I’ve been doing Yoga for about two and a half months now to build up my core and flexibility after a serious operation. I do it before and after my normal gym workouts, totalling about an hours-worth a day. I used to avoid the idea of Yoga like the plague, as I believed it was emasculating due to insecurities at the time.

After participating Yoga class by chance (I was using the room at the time in the gym and decided to just join them), I became hooked.

I’m a guy that tries to maintain focus on my workouts. Since the classes came to an end, I’ve been using the free weight area to do my own routine. But I’ve started to get this feeling that girls (and even guys) are trying to seek out my eye contact in the mirrors. I’ve seen girls change from what they were doing to almost copying me completely. Sometimes it even feels ridiculously obvious. I’ve had girls go directly in front of me despite the entire free-zone being empty. I’ve even tested some of them by looking back directly at them, which really has me convinced 

Now I could be completely wrong (and even a little crazy), but I’m starting to feel that Yoga is like a gateway to heaven for straight men. I’ve been a lifter for almost 5 years and I have never experienced girls gawping at me the way (I think) they have since I started to get good.

It find it ironic because the time I spent focusing on bodybuilding was the time I actually craved attention from women. Now I have even had girls start conversations with me just because I feel that I stand out from other lifters. I honestly feel like I can pick almost any single girl I want there without an issue.

I’ve also noticed that sex is better too. I recently started again after almost a year out and I’ve received compliments on my stamina and lasting long. 

I’m really starting to think that Yoga is a huge thing that most guys are missing out on because they feel emasculated. Seriously, I freaking love it. 

Guys: Have you had a similar experience since starting Yoga? Has it improved your experience with women in general? 

Ladies: How often do you come across these kind of guys? Is there anything in particular that grabs your attention?

Some context: I mainly wanted to join to help increase my flexibility(I do a lot of martial arts and didn't want to keep feeling like I'm being held back from improving over time because of my stiff AF body). I was pretty nervous as hell initially, especially about the possibility about being the only male in a room full of highly fit and flexible women and feeling like I'm awkwardly intruding on their space. But afterwards, I immediately saw how welcoming everyone was at the yoga studio I attended, and the instructors so far have been super helpful in helping me with the basics. And even though I felt like I looked like a total idiot figuring out all these new poses and stretches throughout the whole class, a couple very good looking ladies walked up to me afterwards and said they were really impressed with my effort and ability for my first ever class(It's pretty likely that they were just saying it to be nice and encouraging, but hey, I'm still taking it as an ego boost and even more reason for motivation ;)  ). 

Most importantly though, I have never felt so energized and refreshed immediately after a workout before. As much as I also enjoy martial arts and weight training, I feel pretty exhausted for a several hours/good chunk of the day after a tough workout before I get that fresh energy boost. Yoga so far feels like instant gratification in comparison, which is awesome and I can already tell is a really addicting feeling!

I am getting sorta concerned about it, since obviously I can’t just stretch all day. I have been practicing for 4 months now, if that makes any difference. I also crave getting a massage, if that means anything. And not just because they feel good; it seems like it would make the feeling go away.

448,"Next step in my practice is diet, but I’m a little lost. Suggestions?","Hi yogis, thank you in advance for any insight you can give me before I change my diet. Here’s some background...
- female turning 40 soon
- started yoga in Sep 2017, and lost 15 pounds from then until now... can’t seem to lose more
- yoga classes 3-5 times a week, and often I’ll jog 5 miles once a week in place of a class
- classes are in a hot studio with infrared, and include HIIT cardio segments

I feel like losing about 10-15 pounds more will increase flexibility, balance, endurance, etc. But losing weight is getting harder with age 🙄

I exercise so much that I get depleted when I don’t eat enough. To be able to work out, I eat a significant amount of calories. Most of my intake is through fish, nuts, avocado, and high fat dairy. Some gluten free grains. Not much meat. 

I wonder if increasing carbs through fruit and grains will trigger intense cravings and make it harder to lose the weight. Or will they help?

I’m also pretty sore in my muscles most of the time... which I don’t mind, but it baffles me bc I should be adapted to the workouts by now. Maybe I need to incorporate supplements?

Any help is appreciated.

TLDR: I’m nearing the 40 hill and want to lose weight without depleting myself. I love working out. Is there  a way to do this with balance?",yoga

460,will balancing postures in bikram yoga help me even out my hips?,"I've gone to bikram yoga class 4 times so far and I always take a day of rest after, so today is my rest day and I'll go again tomorrow.

Is all bikram yoga the same? Because the one I go to, all they ever do is the same sequence over and over again. We start with this weird breathing exercise to ""warm up from the inside"" even though its a billion degrees in there, then we do a bunch of balancing postures, some squat/lunge like postures and then back postures, then some floor things. The thing I struggle with the most is the balancing ones.

My hips are uneven, I have lateral pelvic tilt and also a right rotated hip, and I was hoping this would help correct it. That's the whole reason I started doing it. I mean, I was hoping it would because I thought for sure it was caused by muscle imbalances and even my physiotherapist said so.
I chose bikram because I enjoy the heat and think all other yoga is boring so I thought the heat would give me incentive to go, and it does.
The bikram yoga teacher told me that my balancing difficulties are most likely due to my uneven hips and that he thought it would help, but it's not getting any better, and in fact, yesterday I was feeling weaker than the first 3 classes I did!!!!!!!

I'm feeling discouraged. Do you think I should keep going, like will this help my hips, or just make things worse?

I really suck at the balancing postures (most likely because of my uneven hip issue), and it's definitely not just lack of balance, although I do struggle with a definite lack of balance... but the stabilizing muscles in my hips and legs tire so fast, incredibly fast, and it's a lot worse on one side than the other, so I'm guessing that IS a muscle imbalance. I'm just feeling really discouraged because I'm not new to working out, I've been bodybuilding and playing sports for years, so I don't know why I've developed this muscle imbalance and why I'm struggling so much with the balancing postures. The muscles that are responsible for keeping me upright on one foot are so weak, I just don't know how that even happened and I'm hoping this will help get me in better shape but I'm worried I'm doing it for nothing and that it won't help.

462,The Big Secret,"The big secret of yoga is that you will make the most progress outside of class. Yoga classes are really for demonstrating flexibility (especially your average Vinyasa class). If you actually want to become flexible you need to do fascia massages and hold poses for longer periods of time depending on what your body needs. It is worth learning the Ashtanga sequence so you have a yoga sequence you can run through at any time, holding poses for longer as you body requires.

Don't get me wrong - you will def get stronger and more flexible doing classes but it is only practicing yoga mindfully on your own where the real power lies. ",yoga
463,"Is Iyengar yoga crazy, or was my Iyengar teacher crazy?","I've been practicing yoga for more than 10 years now.  I am frankly not ""good"" at yoga for being in it so long, but yoga has changed my body and mind for the better and I truly love it.  In short, I am pretty good at embracing the spirit of the practice, if not at actually doing all the bendy stuff.  

In all my time in yoga I have had the fortune to see many styles of teaching and many styles of yoga.  Today however, was by far my worst yoga experience.  I went to an Iyengar class with a teacher who was a former director a well known Iyengar school.  From the beginning the class was pretty mean and disjointed.  The teacher made snide comments because I put my mat against a wall, but then told us all to move up against the wall.  The teacher had weird comments about the fact we grabbed some foam blocks but didn't tell us at the beginning to grab the wood blocks he apparently preferred.  It went on like this.  The dude just always had a condescending way to say everything.  I was expecting lots of talking through basic poses, but I wasn't expecting it to be so unhinged, disorganized, and disrespectful.  Nothing in the class was particularly difficult (or useful to be honest).  It was just the attitude.

Ultimately my wife, who has developed a very strong practice over many years, just up and left class, something I have never seen her do before.  I've seen a lot of teachers that are authoritative, but never really mean.  And I have seen a lot of teachers who are inexperienced, but never felt they were incompetent.  This guy was mean and incompetent and I found the experience baffling.  I read more about Iyengar and it sounds like it can tend towards being a bit regimented.  Is this what all these classes are like?  The whole mindset seemed to be contrary to all of the humility, equanimity, and kindness that I have learned are the core of yoga.",yoga

I'm also trying to remind myself that there are Christians who don't take everything from the bible. I guess I'm struggling with my values.

501,What are the basic positions someone should learn when first practicing yoga?,"I will say. I have been a lurker for a while (few years) and browsed the FAQs extensively, but noticed this question is not answered directly within the FAQ, instead there are many nuanced approaches and answers to this all supported by their own logic which I can get behind. Then you have the section about reasons including 20 something year old males, depression, weight loss, etc.

But with that wealth of information, I noticed there is not a generalized one size fits all approach, and for obvious reasons. But I was wondering, what collection of poses would you recommend to a beginner and what resources would you direct them to? Of the 30 day challenge video series, many of them are not new-user friendly of course, most seem intermediate. And a lot of the FAQ's jargon seems predicated on the idea that the beginner already has some above average familiarity with yoga.

I am familiar with Antranik of course given my dedication to bodyweight fitness and as a result figured I would just default to his videos, but I noticed although I was technically able to follow along and keep up, it was not beginner friendly.

My roommate is slightly interested in yoga but years ago apparently he was into it, and he mentioned I should start with the 8 Somerset poses, but I looked into that and it seems that claim of his wasn't necessarily backed by any sort of science and given the questionable validity of the claim as well as his mediocre credentials, I didn't know how much value to place on that recommendation after researching into it, my research seemed underwhelming comparatively speaking to what he implied.

I was just wondering, if you do not know for certain of course that is fine, but in your opinion and experience, as I am currently soliciting as much as possible, what do you think the best approach for a beginner would be? I am specifically curious as to what collection of poses you would recommend to the average person.

Keep in mind I am heavily familiar with the FAQ, so I am not looking for that information, but either new information or your perspective on existing information within the FAQ.

Now keep in mind I am specifically not including information about myself because I do not want an answer tailored to me, I just want to know your specific opinion about what you would recommend to a beginner. That said, once that inquiry is satisfied, feel free to give personalized advice and support it with anecdotes if you want.

one thing that I find ridiculous and I cannot find an excuse for teachers doing that:

Before the class, some teachers say ""Say hi to someone you don't know"" or ""Introduce yourself to a person next to you"".

I absolutely cannot stand that. In years of living in SF I have encountered that many times, and if I remember the teacher's name I will not attend their class again. This forced smiling and ""Haaaai my name is Blah..."" drive me nuts. I asked my yogi friends many times - nobody likes it! I never remember the names or faces as we do not have any meaningful interactions during the class. Of course, I could sit through it with a straight face but that is also an effort in an unpleasant situation. I find these moments so unpleasant! And it's a kick off for the yoga class.

(More specifically I finished Yoga with Adriene Revolution day 24 two days ago) I haven’t followed Adriene but have continued a few of my own stretches over the past couple of days. So the point of this is that I’m someone who has a past history with very severe anxiety. I was bed bound and completely agoraphobic for 2 years and then for another couple of years after that I somewhat functioned but was still a complete mess. With a lot of patience I got better, so better that for the past 2 years I’ve been doing fantastic. I’ve been working toward my dreams and absolutely love life, anxiety was 100% a thing of the past to the point where it was hard to believe I was ever so bad. That is, until 5 days ago. I felt a little off on Friday, mentally foggy and a little down. I didn’t think much of it and continued my regular routine which included yoga. Well I’ve progressively gotten mentally worse with each day since and it’s honestly to a point where it is scarily similar to what I experienced in the past, I’ve already been having a hard time functioning again.

I’ve just been trying to think about what could have caused this and I’ve heard a lot about yoga releasing emotions and that is the only thing I’ve really changed recently. Could the yoga potentially be bringing my history with crippling anxiety back to the surface? The thing is, it has done wonders for me physically already. My lower back pain is basically gone and I am definitely stronger and slightly more flexible. I actually crave doing it now and will be sad to stop but I also have to put my mental health first.

592,Jade vs. Manduka- Which is the better mat for bony joints?,"Hello Reddit Yogis! I'm fast approaching my one year in yoga (yay!) I have found a new passion, a new lease on life, and inner peace through yoga classes through my university, as well as through a traditional studio. 
My very first mat was a Giam mat (maybe 3-4mm thick) I got for cheap on clearance. However, although incredibly cute, that mat proved too thin, as I have sensitive, bony knees and feet, and although I was flexible enough to do poses such as Monkey and Hero, I found the bone pain too unbearable to go deep in such postures. In January I bought a thick exercise mat for $12 at my local Marshall's, which proved wonderful for deep restorative yoga... for a while. 
However, this mat is already starting to show wear and tear and it's starting to slide as well. I'm thinking about giving the mat to my boyfriend who wants to learn and investing in a mat I won't have to worry about replacing in a couple years. 
So my question to you is which mat is better, Jade Yoga or Manduka? I do yoga 3-5 times a week in a studio and 2-4 times a week at home, so I'd be using the mat just about every day. My two main concerns are the amount of time it'll last and how thick and cushiony the mat is. So which do you think would fit my yoga style better, Jade or Manduka? Thank you in advance. TL;DR Which mat has better cushioning and wear and tear, Jade Yoga or Manduka mats?",yoga

I'm an EMT/fire fighter at a small, volunteer department. We recently started doing department workouts together to keep in shape and be ready if something happens.

 As we've been doing more training, I've noticed how many of the guys struggle from problems stemming from lack of flexibility, bodily awareness, and breathing mindfulness. I've long been a proponent of yoga and think it's exactly what we need to fully round out our training, but many of the guys seem to be put off by the idea. I've heard a whole variety of reasons- the classic ""I'm not flexible"" (which I have made very clear isn't an issue, it will improve with time and there's much more to it than being able to touch your toes) to things like ""That seems pretty hippie I don't think it's for me"". 

In reality, knowing these guys extremely well, I think most of the excuses are really stemming from the machismo that the fire service holds so dear, as well as a lack of understanding about what yoga is really about. Yoga is a ""woman's exercise"" and they don't want to participate. Does anybody have any tips on how I may change that mindset, or some good ideas for a flow that I could introduce to the more willing guys that may coax the others along/show them why I think it would be so helpful?",yoga

615,Tips for pincha/forearm balance away from the wall,"Hello! This is my first time posting. I have searched for pincha/forearm posts through here but haven't quite found the right advice for my situation.

I have been working very hard recently to do pincha/forearm stand. My dolpin pose still isn't shortened enough for me to lift one leg and press up into pincha so I kick up into it. I can kick up at the wall easily &amp; hold for over 5 breaths with (semi) straight legs. I don't really even need to touch the wall anymore, it's just helpful for me to have as a reference point so I don't overshoot.

However, whenever I try to kick into the pose without a wall nearby, I either overshoot and have to twist and bail OR I undershoot &amp; just come back down. Does anyone have any tips to get me off the wall? I think my strength is there, I just haven't found my balance point. I drill the pose frequently every day &amp; do the proper strengthening exercises as well. I'd really like to nail this before summer's end!

I also seem to kick and bring my legs up together, so maybe if I kicked into split legs, that would help me balance more easily. But I'm not sure how to kick like that.

623,"Serial farter in class, how to deal?","Look, i find farts hilarious and are nothing to be ashamed about. Im also aware that yoga can bring it out in people sometimes. 

However, i take a twice weekly restorative class and this older woman who frequents the class ALWAYS lets loose. I mean, like 6-8 times an hour. The teacher knows this, and has mentioned indirectly in class to not eat before taking a class etc... the worst part is this woman when she farts, she has an audible reaction to her own farting, which makes it 100x more hilarious. She kinda lets out a ""uuuhhhuh"" noise after she farts, kinda a mix between relief and embarrassment. 

Im having a real hard time not laughing out loud, i know its immature but goddamn. Last night she did it again and the teacher went into talking about how we should visualize a balloon in our bellys and that when we breathe out we should expel all the air from the balloon. I had to cover my mouth to hold back my laughter, im pretty sure the teacher said what she said because of the farting and that we both find it funny.

While its all funny, its kind of ruining the class for me. I take the class to get into my body and this totally prevents that. The farting woman is also somewhat rude. She takes up a lot of space and doesnt think about her neighbors, she steals props, pushes her props into other peoples areas, stretches well outside of her mat area, etc..she smacked me in the chest once when strerching then glared at me as if i were in her way. I feel like she is sucking the energy out of the class for her own righteousness. She has mentioned a few times how she gets dinner right before class and has a glass of wine.

I have recently started taking yoga classes, because I have lately suffered some injuries and want to get rid of my hypertonic pelvic floor. I noticed at the first lessons that I am very stiff in many areas and I notice this mainly at the staff pose.

​

[Staff pose](https://i.redd.it/mer5kpwcifi11.jpg)

I tried sitting on a bolster, with a folded towel and yoga block on it, but still my lower back is getting rounded. My sitting bones are pulled towards my knees. Is it good to start practicing this pose on the elevated bolster+towel+block level or is that still not the way to go because of the rounded lower back?

Is it possible that my extremely strong hypertonic pelvic floor influences this pose? Maybe that the pelvic floor muscle is also pulling at my sitting bones? How can I improve this pose or are there other poses which can help with this problem?

I also think i have some anterior pelvic tilt, which you can see on the most right picture. Can someone confirm this? Does this also affect the pose?

​

I hope someone can give me some instructions/advice for working towards an injury-free life :).

639,"Things Change, Practice Stays","Back in March, I was teaching hot yoga seven days a week and practicing for an hour every day. Even though asana is only one small component of yoga, I was appreciative of my physical practice and proud of what I had been able to accomplish over almost nine years.

And then in April, I woke up one morning with back pain so bad I couldn’t move. Out of nowhere I suddenly couldn’t even walk. I would drag myself onto the floor to do cat-cow and ustrasana, but my knees were so swollen I couldn’t do child’s pose and my back hurt so badly that laying in savasana was excruciating. 

I spent two months battling randomly swelling joints, periods of complete immobility, and the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. Finally at the beginning of June I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own joints, synovial fluid, and systems. I’ve since begun treatment and am starting to get some mobility and strength back, but I’ve lost nearly 60 lbs and am weaker than I have ever been. I also have nowhere near the range of motion I had back in March, and have pain or limited mobility in most parts of my body.

My practice has completely changed. RA saps energy, and one of its primary symptoms is extreme fatigue. I used to be in the hot room for hours at time. Now I do a few poses at home and take a break. I practice about 15-30 minutes at a time a few times a day. I take a weekly chair yoga class and gentle yoga twice a week with brilliant teachers. I focus on comfort, acceptance, and compassion for my body and mind. Practice exists to provide me with mental and physical relief from a disease that has taken a lot from me. It has been difficult not to be bitter about losing so much of what I worked for on a physical level, but I am starting to realize the beautiful things this experience has given me. When I am able to work again, I will be better equipped to meet my students where they are, and can reaffirm that this practice has so much more to offer than postures. It stayed with me through every moment of suffering and every moment of complete discouragement. I would practice pranayama to calm myself when the pain medication couldn’t touch what was happening, and I would meditate when my brain went a million miles an hour living in limbo and waiting for diagnosis. My practice was always there, maybe not in the form I wanted or was used to, but it held me up when I felt powerless.

Life changes fast. I’m living in what feels like a completely different body and mind. Everything is shaky and it feels hard sometimes to find solid ground. But when I practice, I’m home. It doesn’t matter how it looks or how strong I am. There I am present, I am whole, and I am well. Nothing can ever take my practice from me, ever. And that is the most comforting, reassuring thing I could possibly know in this moment. And despite how I did, I am so grateful to have learned that.

So when I signed up for yoga this year, I never expected to be the only guy. 

On our first class, I walked in and instantly felt that I should drop the class. I was the only guy in the room and felt so out of place.

I made sure to be honest for my inspiration and say that I’m trying to rehab from some past injuries. I’m still concerned that I won’t be able to stay focused this semester during the class because I’m too worried about what other people think of me. I don’t want to come across as being there just to stare or to meet girls. Should I just drop the class since I’m so concerned?

When I started a twice daily (morning and night) yoga practice I started having more good neck days than bad neck days for the first time in several years. Today happens to be a really bad neck day but it's the first one I've had like this in a month and a half. I remember when this was almost everyday.

656,How long does it take to gain flexibility?,"So, basically I have been doing yoga for over 2 years now and still cannot sit up straight with straight legs, can barely do cobra some days, and my hips in bound-angle pose are about as far from touching the ground as is physiologically possible, just to name a few things. 

However, when I started doing yoga I didn’t really do it correctly (I believe) and not very often or long, but I have been doing whole-body stretching (not yoga) to increase flexibility, after warming up to prevent injury, for almost a year now p, as well as doing yoga on a far more regular basis for spiritual reasons, and even after stretching everyday (sometimes twice a day), and warming up properly beforehand I still cannot sit up straight in staff pose consistently (if I am full warmed up if I’m lucky I can just get my legs straight with a straight back but to get to that point it took about 9-10 months and in almost a year later it hasn’t improved by more than half and inch at best).

It’s like my muscles are scared to allow me more range of motion. I know that physiologically we all have different shaped joints and different connective tissue and ligaments, etc, but even if I am one of those people who will never be able to do a decent backbend or even the splits, surely I should be able to at least touch my toes?

Actually, the only progress I have actually seen (just slightly but still noticeable) is my shoulder mobility and overhead extension (my lats must be on my side, haha. No pun intended). 

You know, ironically, I’m able to flat-foot squat with ease (even with both feet together on good days), so I have no idea how I can do something like that when I’m about as mobile as a steel cable.
Literally, my hips and pirformis muscles are so tight I get knee pain (with flexed feet) when doing thread the needle, fire log pose (though not every day), and if I’ve been doing a lot of exercise my knees can hurt sitting in sukasana (cross-legged), but that’s only when I try to lightly stretch by leaning forward.

Thanks. Peace.",yoga

660,My journey with yoga (longer post),"Hello and namaste!

This is a post about how yoga helped me in my life, maybe you will find it interesting and helpful, I would also appriciate the feedback. English is not my first language, so I am sorry for any lingual mistakes.

About a year ago (age 27), I went through my worst depression period ever (not eating, not sleeping, not even moving much), I developed all sorts of anxiety disorders, I was really struggling to find myself as a person and thinking about how I have been living my life that led me to that moment. Before that time I was working as a software developer and I was finishing my computer science diploma, I had a lot on my back and was really tired and unhappy, so I spent all my free time smoking weed and playing video games, closing myself into a world that was smaller and unhappier each day. I was not hanging out with my friends anymore and did not have much interest in anything, my diet was so bad I won't even talk about that. I felt bad about myself and didn't know how to change things. I somehow managed to finish my diploma but it didn't make me feel like it was suppose to. From there things really started to go downhill, I got sick with some rare bacterial infection that crashed my immune system, which I think was mostly caused with how I was living my life. Because of this I lost my work, no one knew what exactly was wrong with my health and if am getting better anytime soon, so I got laid off. My girlfriend left me, she couldn't handle the state I was in and our relationship was non-existant. Everything led to somekind of mental breakdown, but with a lot of help of a few people I had left, I somehow managed not to do anything stupid and realized that I really need to change things about me and my life. The path had a lot of ups and downs and everything was really hard, especially at the start, but I kept getting up even when I lost all motivation, kept on going and learning. I was keeping myself busy and stayed by myself most of the time, sometimes feeling really lonely, yet I think the solitude had a big impact on everything I learned. And I must say I learned so much and it helped me to find out who I really am and what I really wanted to do in my life. I learned where I want to go and the most important thing is, I am healthy again.

So at first I realized I needed to start at the basics, diet, some kind of physical activity, calmness of mind that of course brings good sleep (I was refusing to take any antidepressants, because I think happiness should come from within the person not from a pill). Since I lost my work and I have somehow managed to finish my diploma, I had a lot of time to do an indepth research about this things. Diet was kinda of hard, since I lost all the interest for food. I started learning a lot about diet and food industry, to keep myself motivated to find meaning in eating food. I learned about how beneficial vegeterian diet can be for someone and I saw only good reasons in this, it seemed like the only logical diet for me. I started to slowly eat more because I knew my body needs the nutrients to function properly. I first came across yoga and what excatly yoga is (at that time I tought it was just some form of physical exercise), when I was researching breathing and meditation. Yoga tought me how noone should be hurt and for the first time in a long time I really felt good about myself, since I was working hard not to hurt anyone. I started doing breathing exercises and slowly developed a daily meditation practice which helped me to calm down my mind and I started to think and see things more clearly. I was also amazed with the yoga poses, especially hand balance poses. It looked really hard, but I wanted to do that one day. I started doing research on everything connected with controlling your body and bodyweight, this is where I found the similar aspects within yoga asanas and bodyweight exercises. I started doing exercises for full body strenght combined with a lot of asanas and slowly developed my exercising routines. I learned which poses I really enjoy and which poses I want to learn. After a few months of getting in better physical condition, I was already setting my goals for some advanced poses and here is where I realized how much time and effort I am putting into this and that this is something I actually really love doing, being active and staying healthy. I started running in nature and hiking mountains, which also had great impact on my mental state.

So here I am one year later and yoga now plays a great role in my life. I got my health back again, somehow my body managed to fight off the infection, no one really knows how, I am full of energy and I feel stronger as ever. I have achieved all my goals I have set for myself and even surpassed some, I now know that a lot is possible with the right mindset. I have decided on what I am going to do in my life because I want to do it and not care about what other people think, who I should be or what should I do. I am now helping an elderly lady with her everyday stuff which brings me some income to get me by and I feel really good about this. I don't do any work with computers anymore, I try to keep away from them, I don't care about how much money I can make and what I can buy with that, I will no longer stay on my previous path which I think was destructive for my life. I have met some wonderul people who I share interest with and I feel good and relaxed around them, I am thinking of doing a climbing course since I want to go to the mountains even more. In october I will start my first semester at a yoga school, first only practicing and after a while learning on yoga training. This is what I love to do, I love to be and stay healthy and I want to do my best to try and teach others about being healthy. I will do everything in my power to achieve this.

Here is a picture which shows how my outside look changed and I think it also represents the changes in my mental state. Left side is a about a year ago, when things were still really bad and the right side is now.

Thank you for reading. :)

EDIT:  I made a quick google document about my favourite asanas and how my routines look like for anyone who was wondering. It is missing the evening section of stretching poses (folds and bends), I will add that once I have more time, I will also update other sections if something changes. This is just how I like to do my routines and I also advise you to find and develop your own favourite asanas and routines so you will keep doing them consistenly. Asanas are mostly written in Sanskrit, I prefer it that way so I can learn the names.

666,Do you feel “high” when you’ve been in your best health?,"Do you guys get this feeling too, where when you’ve been meditating, exercising, and eating well consistently, you just feel sooo fucking good? I was walking to the bus stop yesterday after having a great slow morning involving yoga after a two week break. I felt so fucking good. Like too good to be true good. It’s like being high. The high that comes with taking care of yourself, of being in your best physical and mental health. A long-term high, created from investments rather than consuming something. There’s nothing like it. The clarity of mind you acquire, the peacefulness, the pleasure of being in your body...  

Thinking about this because last night I drank quite a bit and relapsed because I was drunk, smoking five cigarettes over the night. Today, I feel like getting intoxicated really kind of undoes that healthy natural feeling very quickly. It’s like I gotta get back into the swing of things and recover.

I took ten days off a couple of weeks ago and noticed that the tightness in my hips was completely gone. I’ve since returned to class and the pain is now back.

I initially thought it was other exercises I was doing that was causing the tightness (running, cycling, circuit training), so thought the yoga would help release the tightness in the hips. My husband also goes to the classes and is noticing the same kind of thing. 

Is it possible for hot yoga to cause tightness in the hips? I feel like maybe because your body is so warm, it’s possible to push harder than you really should and cause injury/strain.

For around a month now, I’ve also started following the courses in Light on Yoga in addition to some classes at studios. I’m on week 4 of the courses.

I’m having a lot of trouble settling into savasana in these courses. I get into each of the other poses easily enough, including the shoulder stand (currently holding for 5:30) and halasana (holding for 1:45). But when I come out of halasana I find it nearly impossible to flatten my back. I need to add in several twists and/or bridge postures before I can feel comfortable lying flat.

I assumed I might have too much of a bend in my back during halasana but I’ve tried videotaping myself during the pose and I think it looked pretty normal. Are there any other common pitfalls I might be experiencing, or other things I might be missing? Has anyone else had this trouble?

703,Trouble keeping my eyes closed,"I've had a home practice for a little while and I went to my first class last night. (Prenatal!) The instructor told us to close our eyes as we did some breathing exercises and again at the end as we relaxed laying on our sides (she even offered a lavender scented wash rag that she laid over our eyes to help us relax). 

But neither during the earlier breathing exercises or the cool down at the end with the cloth could I keep my eyes closed. They were either twitching uncontrollably or open. I could not rest them. 

I thought it may be anxiety about being in an open, public space, but it isn't like I felt self conscious or unsafe. Is this something that comes with practice? With time? Am I the only one that struggles with this?

I don't think I've closed my eyes much during my home practice, so I can't say if it was a surge of energy from the practice or if it was because I was out of my element. Either way, the twitching was bothersome and not being able to rest them was distracting and took me out of the desirable head space.

710,Discussion: Yoga with aphantasia (inability to visualise),"Apologies for the lengthy post, a lot to unpack here.

My background:

I've been doing yoga for 20 years, teaching for 13, and always struggled with anything that involves visualisation. In my practice I favour meditation based on nirguna approaches (emptiness, mindfulness) rather than visualisations.

Aphantasia:

Last year I found out that I have a disorder called aphantasia. I'm completely unable to form mental images. At all - I can't even visualise my daughter's face, and I saw her two minutes ago. In the general population there's a spectrum, with people varying in their ability to visualise. I think those most affected are about 1-3% of the population.

I didn't know I had an issue until I happened to read about it, and then spoke to some psychologist friends. I assumed that everyone else was being metaphorical when they said they could mentally visualise things. But it turns out you all can!

Impact on yoga:

I don't think this is a problem for my practice, and in some ways it helps - I'm never disturbed by imagery or sounds in meditation, though my thoughts do still wander. But it has made me realise that I've probably not taught visualisation-based techniques as well as I could have, so I'm working on that. I usually stick to the templates my teachers taught me for those anyway, so I shouldn't be too far off (and they're usually very well received by students).

Questions:

Has anyone else ever encountered this, either themselves or with students?

For those of you with mental imagery (still seems bizarre to me), how do you feel that someone without that might be affected, either personally or in terms of teaching?

Reflection:

I think its absolutely wild that something so fundamental could be so hidden from me. In a way it feels like a small example of self-realisation in my own life! 

But for teachers out there, do think about how this might affect some of your students. ",yoga
711,What’s wrong with my legs?!,"I am a pretty flexible person, and I do yoga tapes regularly. I can do some of the advanced moves, go pretty far in stretches, etc.  I have decent balance in most poses. All in all, I’m progressing nicely! 

But, I have trouble with this one odd thing!

In a forward bend, standing or seated, I can nearly put my head to my knees and easily grab my feet with my legs straight. 

BUT...

If the pose involves me sticking my leg straight out (with the exception of half moon), I CANNOT get my legs straight. It throws me completely off balance to try. Think of poses like...downward dog split, standing split, boat pose, or recently a pose (don’t know the name) where I was basically in tree pose and they had me stick a leg out and hold my toes with my fingers.

I get that holding a leg out vs. sitting is different, but it seems odd I have quite this much trouble. 

Do I need to be more flexible? Or have more muscle in my legs? Or both?

Any insights? ",yoga

713,My beginner problems with video courses of yoga,"Hello everyone.

Recently got interested into yoga. Bought a mat, but here is the problem i am facing.

I tried ""Adriene's 30 day yoga challenge"" and ""3 week yoga retreat"" - both of them have the same issue. They do everything VERY FAST. Adriene is better, she take it slower, but doesn't describe poses that she does. 
Due to my room, my yoga matte is paralell to the TV, so i have to turn my neck around all the time and see which pose did she move to now. + she uses a lot of words that i am not familiar with. 
3 week yoga retreat - they are just doing it too fast, like they think you know what will be the next yoga pose and while you understand you need to switch, you are rushing into it, which becomes more of a cardio than yoga. 

Maybe it's my begginner issues. But anyone faced this before?

718,I need encouragement.,"Sorry for the long post but i have to get this off my chest..

So, maintaining a regular yoga practice has been a goal of mine for over a year now. I have had lower back/sciatica issues on and off for many years. My pain would come and go but a while back it came and did not go! I was in significant pain every day. I tried chiropractic care which helped some but didn't get me very far. I decided to incorporate yoga into my routine for both the physical and mental benefits. I started small by getting myself acquainted with yoga using videos online. Once I had the confidence to join a class I started going three times a week. I felt great on the days I had class but I didn't really see a big enough reduction in my daily pain. My Chiropractor suggested that I go for an MRI which I did. I found out that I had two bulging discs in my back that were putting pressure on my spinal cord and no amount of yoga or chiropractic care was going to fix that. I needed surgery. So I had the surgery and went through the recovery process where I couldn't lift or do any real physical activity for over three months. Once that period of time was up I went through physical therapy. I have since been released from physical therapy and am on my own. My pain is gone for the most part aside from some soreness and tension. The thing is I have ZERO flexibility and I feel like I am in a worse position to start practicing yoga again than I was when I started in the first place! I really want to get back into it because the benefits I got from it before were too many to count and I miss it dearly. I'm tired of complaining about this to family and friends and was hoping that this would be a good community to turn to. Any tips, guidance or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated!

Tl;dr: Was practicing yoga for a while. Had to stop because I had surgery. Now I'm left less flexible than before and very discouraged.",yoga

725,Advice needed to practice on the trail,"Hello everyone, fairly new yogi here. This is my first post. I’m an avid backpacker (the camping kind) and I would love to incorporate yoga into trips. I’m about to go on a 6 night trip hiking ~10 miles a day and I would love to do some yoga daily, to stretch my tired legs but also to stay active in my upper body and maybe avoid t-rex arms.

I tried some yoga on a similar trip earlier this summer, and I even guided my friends and it was fun. We only did a few poses but it inspired me to want to do more with it. My dilemma here is that I’ve only been consistently practicing for about 8 months now and I’m an Adrienne junky. I pull up a Yoga with Adrienne youtube video every morning to practice and they’ve pretty drastically changed how I feel for the rest of the day and I love it. Her guiding words help keep me focused and allow me to really lose myself in the practice, and it’s very meditative for me. However, when I’m in a situation where I don’t have access to youtube, I’m sort of at a loss what to do, I can’t keep focused and I can never come up with the poses I know I know.

In short, these are my questions, and I’d love your advice:

1. What poses/series of poses do you recommend for someone hiking for many days with a pack in the woods?

2. How should I remember these poses? I’d like to practice for at least 20 or 30 minutes and my brain fizzles at the thought of it.

3. This isn’t super specific to my backpacking situation, but how can I grow my practice to transition out of being solely reliant on a guided video while still keeping my mind clear and the overall experience meditative.

2. I'm the only guy, so I worry that the girls there will be annoyed by my presence. I feel like I'm intruding. So even if my intentions are mostly pure, if my presence annoys the others then perhaps the right action is to not go. 

3. Sometimes I can't help but 'admire' the great dance skills of those around me. I will try to solve this by moving to the front of class. But then 1. More will see my bad dance moves and 2. I won't be able to see the instructor.

741,"Pronunciation of ""namaste""","It's pronounced ""nuh-muh-steh"" not ""nah-mah-stay"". It might seem like no big deal, but it really bothers me.

What if people pronounced Ave Maria ""ayve-mariah"" or went to France and said ""bon-jower""? I feel like it's disrespectful. 

What are your thoughts?

Edit: blows my mind and makes me sad that there is so much resistance to even trying to say an ancient Sanskrit word that has deep meaning correctly. You don't need an Indian accent. You just need to try, because trying shows respect. 

If I said Buddha ""bud-ha"" and a Buddist corrected me and said it's ""bhud-thuh"" and I said ""boo-duh"" because that's the closest I could get to, it's better than will fully saying ""bud-ha"", knowing that it's wrong. 

Now imagine that millions of people insisted on saying ""bud-ha"" and told the Buddhist to chill out because it's just a word. Namaste isn't just a word like cat or dog. It's said at the end of each practice for a very special reason. 

The vast majority if people don't know that they're saying it wrong; they're saying it as they were taught. It's possible to fix that.

I have been dabbling with the yogic &amp; vedic culture for around 5 years, but am a relatively new teacher. I still get nervous before every class, but when I do get on the mat, I seem to get this unexplainable concentration that I usually don't have when practicing solo. It's an inner zone where everything in the world is in the right place and I feel like some of my students can feed on it.

But the thing that is troubling me, is that after I close the class, I'm left in this zone of inner contentment and am unable to be sharp enough to deal with outer reality, as it seems somehow unimportant. I can answer a few questions from the students with ease, but after that I have the need to go relax in silence. I feel so blissful but at the same time incapable of handling basic material things. Today after class I rolled up my mat, and then just forgot it in the hall as I went straight to the beach outside to enjoy the nature. Luckily some of my students spotted it and brought it for me. I was so absorbed it didn't even cross my mind that there were some material ""belongings"" to take care of.

It's such a double edged sword, because obviously, being content feels great but at the same time I feel like a dementic in the real world. It usually balances out after a few hours and I feel normal, but was just wondering if any of you have some insight on this? Thanks.

I dread this pose every time I go to class. It aches in the socket of my hip and it puts a lot of pressure on my knee and my front leg quad is not happy.

I can't figure out if it's a form problem--one instructor told me not to sink into my joints, but it didn't help the pain--or a strength problem, since holding Crescent Pose is pretty tiring for me too. But Bound Revolved Side Angle isn't even close to being as painful as Humble Warrior. Or is it a flexibility issue, maybe? If it's flexibility, I can't figure out what's so tight that it makes me feel like death in this pose. 

Is this pose painful for anyone else? Is it just how it is?",yoga

During my running form analysis, I found out that my lower back, thigh area drops down severely, when landing on the right leg. To my knowledge, it is due to the fact that some muscle is not being engaged or is too weak.

Can you advise what yoga poses could help me with this particular muscle/problem and how can I improve upon this problem?

763,I cried for the last 5 mins of class today.,"I'm a 34 year old dude suffering from major depression and ptsd induced night terrors.

I joined the gym and started yoga classes about 5 weeks ago. I have been to yoga, body balance, spin, boxerfit, core stability, and now started taekwondo. I was living very much a sedantary life the past two years, sitting on the sofa, eating poorly, lots of crying an panic attacks... So for me to be moving now is a massive feat for me.

However, I was all well and good following the routine in class, then on YouTube at home, but they were all pretty active classes. Today I went to a midday class that was mainly senior citizens, it was also more introspective and meditative than I have been before. I don't know why, but the last few minutes of breathing, and hearing the instructor say So Hum and explain the meaning that we should accept ourselves as we are I lost it.

I started bawling. I finished the breathing and slight movements the best I could. But this was the first time I had an emotional connection whilst practicing, and I'm not sure I'm pleased with it. I don't know if I can face that eruption of overwhelming loss and incomprehension inside of me. I think I should, but I am kinda worried I'll unlocking thoughts and emotions that I am not capable of dealing with alone. My instructor gave me a massive hug after and made sure I was OK. But I'm not sure I can go back to that class. 

Have you found that yoga can release emotions that weren't considered before? Should I return to that same class? Any advice at all?

779,Yoga Teacher Training fail.,"I heard of this awful thing happened to a friend at a yoga studio recently. This woman I know suffers from major depression, but tries to hide it out of pride. This person took a teacher training class. After fulfilling the major requirements and faithfully going to classes, she was short a couple of hours of volunteer teaching. She, admittedly, wasn't very good in the practice hours she did put in. Her classmates didn't attend a class she tried to set up. The studio felt they were so self important that they refused to give a signed certificate. After all, it might be bad PR for the studio if this person volunteered somewhere and the name of the studio was attached! The person became desperate enough to make a suicide attempt. After making something of a recovery, she asked for a second chance, so she could qualify to teach as a volunteer. The studio owner refused to make any concession and gave vague answers that amounted to ""no, tough luck."" The owner of the studio felt it was more important to protect the reputation of the studio at all costs. Why give a little boost of confidence to a suicidal mental patient? Better they kill themselves and everyone would be more comfortable. I guess they decided she was victim of the ""trance of scarcity,"" and her own negative thoughts, right? Why should it be up to the studio to help out and show some kindness? Sorry, I know the sarcasm probably doesn't come across well, but I'm disgusted at the hypocrisy of this place that dares to preach the yamas and niyamas and still pulls this crap.",yoga
780,"Finally, after 200+ handstand failures","I’ve been doing Yoga for about 2 and a half months now since incidentally ending up in a room where Yoga class was beginning. 

I’ve been a lifter for 4 and a half years, but had an accident (peritonitis) two years ago which resulted in having open body surgery that left me with a thick scar that stemmed from under the chest to above the groin. 

Since then, my core has been lagging behind which has affected my compound lifts; primarily squats as my core gives in whenever I try anything over 100kg.

The past two weeks I have been taking it easy with my lifting and focusing more towards yoga. 
After playing around with the crow pose and headstands against the wall, I decided would o to take things to the next level.

I’ve been averaging about 30-45 mins of handstand attempts 4x a week for these last two weeks. Within that time I would estimate that I have fallen over at least 200 times, with my right shoulder and gluteal taking most of the impacts. 

I tried over and over again, both before and after my workouts. Falling over and over again, I continued until I couldn’t any more. Well, today I finally did it for 5 whole seconds on my last attempt of the day! 

To me, it’s both the end and the beginning. 5 seconds was enough to hold myself comfortably in position - it can only go forward from here.

Hopefully my core will continue to strengthen to the point where I can begin walking with my hands. Damn it feels good to be a gansta.

791,Headstand question,"My neighbor recently went to a yoga class with me.  She’s in her early 60’s and has been doing yoga for well over 30 years.

I’m a guy in my late 40’s, been doing yoga for 3 years.  So I’m not comparing what I can do versus what she can do... but I have one question I haven’t figured out.

During inversion, she went into a headstand on her matt.... and folded her legs kinda in a lotus position and closed her eyes and that was it.  She held that effortlessly for a solid 5 minutes, and told me later she could fall asleep doing a headstand.  I believe her.

For me?  I’m up against the wall, straining to hold a headstand for 1 minute.  Even though I’ve been doing yoga 3 years, I just started with the headstands a few months ago.

So aside from a big experience gap, there’s something else going on....

Her headstand is effortless, mine requires a lot of upper body effort to hold myself up and not put all the pressure on my head.

How is that possible that she can do the same thing with no effort?  What am I missing conceptually?

I'm asking because I just had an SI flare up (bed for 3 days and now 3 weeks of still having some pain). I've had to significantly ramp down the intensity of my yoga practice, of course. I'm thinking of using bikram as a way to get back into the swing of things and at least maintain the endurance and strength I have built through my previous routine (3-4 vinyasa or power classes, 2-3 gentler or slow flows per week.)

My fear is that I will keep doing super gentle and sacrum-focused yoga (which I've been doing since my flare-up) and end up losing all of the strength and endurance I've built thus far through my practice. I'm also feeling like (just kind of gut feeling about my body) that I should push through the discomfort a little bit and it will help my body heal. And I'm also thinking that the heat might be beneficial in this case. 

But again, everything I read and hear is contradictory -- and also I feel like my body is telling me to ramp things back up a bit (which is maybe dumb to listen to in the case of a medical condition, but... just saying).

810,muscle action,"I had read something that seemed very simple some months ago that has recently come back to me as something quite profound, muscles only actively contract. So for example when you do a standing forward fold you are contracting the muscles in the front of your body, like your abdominal muscles, this action makes the muscles on your back stretch (passively). The implications of this are pretty big. In the example of the forward fold, it would be unwise to try to engage or place your body in such a way that would contract any muscles in the back of your body, as it would go against the natural actions of the pose!

Another example would be shalambhasana, locust pose. It is a backbend, the front of your body is stretching/expanding, but it is the back of your body that is actively contracting to make this happen! We are all aware of the backbending action, but often think of it as above the body. But we can also think lower body, the legs, the feet. The principle applies just the same here, in locust pose if you actively untuck your feet (so your feet are flat, rather at 90 degrees with leg) then they will be in a position that will aid the muscles in the back of your legs in contracting. Think cobra pose, where we are cue'd to press down the top of our feet, this is the reason why it makes sense to do just that!! 

I've been rethinking much of the poses I do with this in mind. Firelog / double-pigeon pose has been one. I had picked up at some point to practice it with feet at 90 degrees with legs (tucked). But in the pose your leg is bent at the knee, the back of your leg muscles are contracted. It is better to untuck your feet in this pose, as it will naturally fit this action. Funny thing is now that I look the pose up the first result has it pictures just as this! https://www.yogaoutlet.com/guides/how-to-do-fire-log-pose-in-yoga

I’ll be traveling to India from this October-April and I am planning on doing a YTT while in Rishikesh. 

I have it narrowed down to two yoga schools that I feel confident in. One teaches hatha and hatha vinyasa while the other teacher ashtanga vinyasa. 

I’m torn on which one I should take. Which one would you take? Also- if you’ve been to Rishikesh- any recommendations? 

I’m also confused on what “style” of yoga I’ll be able to teach afterwards? So, if I take the hatha course can I ONLY teach hatha yoga and same with ashtanga vinyasa? Or are there other type of classes I’ll be able to teach? Does anyone know what I mean? Haha. 

I just know of some people that took ashtanga vinyasa and I’m pretty sure they are teaching classes called “hot power flow” and stuff like that...

Most of the breathing techniques I know are longer than 3 minutes however I have to keep it short. We will be doing presentations shortly after so the purpose would be to center onself and calm nerves. Any suggestions? I know I can do some box breathing techniques but I wanted to change it up!

I ended up with the car wheel on-top of me, and with that it split my pelvis in two, shattered my hip socket, and broke the top of my femur. I had a 6hr surgery and was on bed rest for 3 months.

Full disclosure, I dont know anything about yoga beyond what my teacher tells me to do for poses. Ive read a couple of articles about it, but all I know is it is the most difficult and rewarding thing Ive ever encountered. 

Judging by the area of the world it was developed and the timeframe, this is easily on par with tai chi and some of the less confrontational martial arts. Even the names of the poses (Warrior 1/2) are martial. Im not sure how, at least in the Western world, it has become associated with women for the most part. Yoga is clearly a form of calisthenics for the body and mind. The focus required and emphasis on calm and inner peace is surely to prepare for war. So its a Martial Art. Right?",yoga

Shortly before his death, soul legend and poet Gil Scott Heron released the song ""New York Is Killing Me."" In the song he mentions several omens which he feels will spell his demise. One can say that Heron had a strong sense of this siddhi mentioned in the above sutra. 

Many here are new and fresh to yoga and feel the practice gives them some sort of ""zest"" in life. After a while, the practice changes and you may notice things about yourself that may manifest into your end days.

844,Flying pigeon questions,"Hey everyone,

I've been working on ""flying"" some asanas, particularly crow and pigeon. I'm having the most trouble with flying pigeon though. So some questions:

1) How open do my hips need to be? Should I be able to touch the floor with flat hands comfortably while holding half chair pose? Right now I'm touching (with some effort) just a bit past the most distal finger joints.

2) How to transition to lifting the leg up? I've managed to get my knee bent and holding there for a little bit, but I feel like I can't get enough weight onto my arms to confidently lift. I'm familiar with engaging my glutes and leaning, as I'm more capable with one legged crow. This is why I'm wondering if it's a hip restriction

3) Just how far should one lean forward? I'm not necessarily afraid of falling, but I feel like I'm almost putting my nose onto the mat...

855,"Finally pinpointed the cause of my achey fingers and swollen PIP joints... and it was belaying, not climbing!","Wanted to share my story in case anyone else is suffering. I'll try to keep it as short as possible!

Background:
I have been experiencing some pain and swelling on the fingers of my left hand, focused on the joints rather than the pulleys. During a recent climbing trip it got pretty bad, and I realized something was really off when I couldn't fully close the fingers in my left hand while my right was normal. 

This was frustrating and perplexing because I always warm up thoroughly before climbing, avoid excessive crimping and sketchy pockets, rest often, and take really good care of my fingers on days off. I assumed it was an overuse thing and took a few days off in hopes it would calm down. 

Realization hits:
After a few days off climbing and lots of finger warm ups on the hike in, the first 3 warm ups felt pretty good. On climb 4 my partner tried something harder and took a long fall. As usual, I got lifted off the ground a few feet, but ascended the rope as high as I could so he could boink back to the route. The moment I gripped the rope to pull up on my gri gri, the pain in my left hand came back in full force. It hit me that this was probably the cause and I decided to do a little research. 

After talking to some experienced climbers in my community, I found out that gripping the rope like this puts a lot of force on the collateral ligaments of your joints. This is apparently NO BUENO but it explains my symptoms perfectly. The collateral ligaments are not strengthened by climbing like our pulleys are, so they are very sensitive to injury.

Proposed solution:
The first thing I did was stop ascending the rope and in just a week my left hand already feels way better. However, ascending the rope is still essential when belaying on steep routes, so I've ordered an ascender and will see if that is more comfortable for my joints.  

If anyone has had a similar experience I'd love to hear about it!

TLDR: Recurring pain and joint swelling on left hand (ring and middle fingers). Figured out this is from ascending the rope after catching long falls while lead belaying. No longer ascending rope by hand (instantly alleviated symptoms) and will be trying out belaying with an ascender.",climbing

I'm going on two years of climbing, and I am keen on programming.

You may be asking yourselves, ""how is this different than Mountain Project?"" Well, MP has some serious UX flaws, but it makes up for these with its wealth of data. You'll find that my app, ""Redpoint"", greatly improves upon MP's UX, and I've added a feature which allows for users to search for routes based upon climbing style. Do you like slab?

861,Thoughts on Tenaya Tarifas and Black Diamond Shadows,"Absolutely love my Tarifas... just amazing shoe overall.  I completely ignore the smell, which could be the only con if it's a thing for you.  I think how well the shoe performs completely outweighs the smell issue.  I wear size 8.

Yesterday I received 2 pairs of Shadows, 9 and 9.5.  Althought I only traversed for 5 minutes with the 9s, I decided not to keep either one.  Main reason:  they just look cheaply made.  You can see glue residue all over the shoe, kind of like when you glue something on a piece of paper, have put too much glue, and glue comes out when you stick the thing down.  Also, the fit was just plain weird (I understand this is a very personal thing, but still thought worth mentioning):  the mouth of the shoe is very small, so you struggle to get your foot in, not because the shoe itself is tight, but because your foot doesn't fit through the mouth.  Once on, the shoes felt very tight midfoot down, and very big midfoot up.  Also, the heel had a lot of air.

My 2 cents... obviously some people out there love the Shadows, just not for me, and wanted to share.

I've been climbing for about 6 months, bouldering indoors twice or three times per week. My finger joints are often slightly painful in between climbs. I've noticed my knuckles crack a lot more than they used to, and it's a bit disconcerting.
I've been using a stretchy plastic ring device for exercising my fingers, opening rather than closing, as I was under the impression this was an appropriate exercise for generally strengthening the ligaments and supportive tissue. But it's not really helping so far (albeit only a couple of weeks use).
I'm kind of worried I might give myself some kind of arthritis, eventually. 

I wondered if anyone would recommend something like cod liver oil or another supplement for joint health. Is this something that's likely to help? Or any other tips really.

I should find out tomorrow exactly how bad it is and whether I will need surgery. For the time being I'm non-weight bearing; I was too short for the usual armpit crutches, so I'm making do (poorly) with elbow crutches, hopping about with extreme cabin fever.

All the broken talus bone stories I read on the internet are dismal, and I'm terrified. I only started climbing 10 months ago, and I've fallen in love with the sport - I ran track, fell and cross country previously but never felt the same passion or drive to train as I do with climbing now. Emotionally I struggle when I can't exercise, so the next six months to rest-of-my-life will be tough.

Can anyone give me some hope for the future? Even if you had a rough time with a talus break, is there any way you can put a positive spin on your story for me so I can at least have some belief I will recover? I'm a fit 20 year old female, I only fell from about two metres and I don't weight very much (very short). Do these work in my favour? Will I ever get back to the same level of movement again?

Doc says grip will get weaker without surgery. So any thoughts, encouragement, etc. would be nice. (BTW, I'm 64 and I started climbing at 55, so I haven't had nearly enough time to climb all I want to climb. I was hoping to continue well into my 70s.)",climbing

921,Tracking climbing volume/ V Points for lead climbing,"Hello all,

I could need some advice on how to track my climbing progress, especially regarding to training volume. I used to track the time spend at the gym only but found this doesn't really mean much. Sometimes I belay much more than I climb, sometimes I spend 30min on one crux, sometimes I speed through lot's of easy climbs in that time.

I like the idea of the V-Points in bouldering where you (my understanding) add up the points for each boulder but don't really see how to apply that to rout climbing.

We use UIAA scale in my gym, but I feel just adding up the grades won't work. Climbing an 8 should ""worth more"" than 2 5's in my opinion.

Any thoughts on this, or maybe someone already has come up with a points system I could use?

Thanks!",climbing
922,you guys ever push a little less because of a new/different belayer?,"Throw away account. I live in the mountains and go climbing, nothing too serious and I don't consider myself great. So my two buddies that I normally climb with weren't around so this new guy who does indoor climbing is belaying me. There was an overhang thing that was (to me) risky and I chickened out. Normally in my head I can tell myself ""the gear is safe, my belayer is on it, I'm safe."" But with this guy I just didn't feel good so I hit the chicken switch and bailed. 

Just curious if you guys who climb a lot don't really care who's belaying you, if it makes a big difference, etc. It's not that the guy was bad.

I am pretty confident in most 11s and am starting to move towards the 12s. However the gym only has 3 or so set and I fear as I approach these and begin to do them easily climbing in a gym will be boring. I am a very goal driven person who is drawn to things they are bad at from the start (golf and climbing in particular) so once I have essentially tapped out my gym I’m not sure how I will be entertained with climbing. I try to go outside as much as possible but being a full time student, part time worker and 3 hours from the nearest crag, it is almost impossible.

Meeting with the Doc

The urologist explained that I needed to go into this knowing it was not a reversible procedure.  He said that even thought it is reversible, it sometimes is impossible due to the anatomy.  After he inspected my junk, he said I was a good candidate for having the procedure done right there in his office.  There is the option to go to a hospital, where they would fully sedate you, etc, so you CAN do that if you want.  The way I had the procedure done was $500, and it was covered by my insurance.

Without getting too technical, he basically explained make a small incision, find each tube, and for each one (there are two), he would cut the tube, tie it, and cauterize it.  He explained the whole thing would be about 15 minutes, and that the only painful part would be when he clamps and pulls the tubes out so he can do his thing.  He said the pain would be very similar to getting kicked in the nuts.  I have never thought I would feel happy about basically paying someone $500 for kicking me in the nuts twice.  The main thing that stayed with me from this consult was a question he asked me: ""how many kids do you have?""... he didn't ask ""do you have kids?"" ... They need to make sure you are fully committed to this, so once I explained to him our reasons why, I was good to go.  In my research, I read about some doctors making their patients attend a ""class"" to ensure that's what they want, or flat out refuse to do the procedure... makes sense.

Day before the procedure

Not much to say here other than I manscapped EVERYTHING, and wanted to wait until the day before so it would be nice and fresh. :)  This is something that needs to be done, so if you don't do it yourself, someone will do it for you... I wasn't cool with trusting someone shaving my balls (but somehow I was okay with someone cutting them open... hrmm).

V-day

I went into the room.  I was asked to take off my pants, and lie on a narrow bed.  About 5 minutes later, a female nurse came in and put iodine all over my stuff... it was very, very cold, and yes, it tickled.  Before the iodine, she took 3 strips of, what looked like to me but I'm sure wasn't, masking tape, and she taped my penis to my stomach (to get it out of the way for the procedure).  I know, weird.  A lot of thoughts went through my mind at this moment... thoughts that I will not share here, but you can imagine some of them, I'm sure.

After about 10 minutes of being in the room with my pants down and the cold iodine just getting colder, the doc came in with 2 female nurses.  Hmm.  Ok, whatevs.  He asked if I'm ready... ""any last words?"" he says.  I say no, and he starts.  He used a small needle to numb where the cut was going to be... this didn't hurt at all.  He made the incision, which I did not feel, and started moving stuff around in there.  I could feel stuff moving inside (imagine noodles being moved around, I guess).  He pulls a section of the first tube out, cuts, ties, and cauterizes (I couldn't see, he was talking to me the whole time).  The only part where I felt ""some"" pain (probably 2 out of 10) was when he said I would:  when he had to ""look"" for the tube.  As he told me he was basically done with the first one, I see smoke come up from down here... yes, I saw, and smelled, my balls being cauterized.  Again, no pain during any of this.  He said he was going to try to use the same incision to find the next tube, which he was able to, and basically repeated the first half it all over again.  Before I knew it, it was done.  THE WORST PART of this whole thing was the anticipation of that sharp ""getting kicked in the balls"" pain, which never came... I was afraid I was going to feel the pain hit me, and buckle or something, but nothing.  A mild discomfort here and there, but that was it.  I had my hands over my forehead the whole time, and during the second half of the procedure, I was actually starting to fall asleep a little bit.  He stitched me up, and I was on my way out, on my feet.

The following sections are directly from my phone, as I took notes daily for a few days after the procedure:

V-day:  currently in car.  Pain is similar to the pain that resides after getting kicked in the balls.  3 out of 10.  Throwing up feeling.  Home.  bag of frozen green beans over underwear... doesn't help with pain at all.  7 hours after: no pain.

Day 1 after procedure:  absolutely no pain.  Did I even get anything done?

Day 2:  slight pain, but very milkd (1 out of 10, if that).  Same pain as if shit had been mangled down there, which it technically was.

Day 3:  swollen a bit, no pain.  Interesting feeling walking with balls bigger than what you're used to.  Belayed my friend for 3 hours, then traversed at the end of the gym:  ALL GOOD.

Days following until yesterday:  no pain, swelling going down daily.

Today (9 days after procedure):  I just came back from the rock climbing gym, where I had a full hard session.  Normal warm up, an hour plus of hard bouldering, and 45 minutes of endurance.  Absolutely no pain at all.

The only thing that resides is a slight discomfort when I jump up and down, as if jumping rope... that's it.  I have a follow up this upcoming Friday.

This is all!  Please feel free to ask any questions about the procedure, private message me, etc.  I think vasectomies are a taboo subject, and they shouldn't be.",climbing

Its been a month now and I havent climbed since ( Ive been traveling since) and my hamstring is still stiff. I cant run without feeling a small amount of pain, I cant stretch my left side because it's too tensed.

1026,Obscure request: Gym rec's with great auto-belay routes? [US specific],"Hello all.

I am a fairly new climber, but I often travel for work (sales) so I find myself in random cities on a regular basis. Since I am usually solo on my trips, I often pay for day passes at nearby climbing gyms to have a few hours of fun. Being a solo climber, I'm limited to auto belay routes and bouldering.

The crowd here seems to be well dispersed, so I was hoping anyone could chime in with recommendations for climbing gyms (within the lower 48) that have particularly interesting or challenging routes with auto belays.

I can usually tackle 5.9-5.10 routes, so I'm always on the lookout for routes in this difficulty range that present a nice challenge.

My hope is that there are some gyms out there that have particularly high routes (beyond 40ft) or varying pitches (within reason, given how an auto belay works).

Thanks in advance.

A couple months ago I was learning to lead and the first time I got on the wall I slipped and fell off like 5 ft up before reaching the first clip and fell on my back (yeah, we should've had a crash pad but it slipped our minds). Ever since that fall I've been terrified of falling while leading. I can easily and happily fall while top roping and sometimes my friends will do a ""rollercoaster"" and lower me super fast and I'm not sacred. I can lead comfortably routes much easier than I top rope because I know I won't fall, but the second someone tells me to fall, I freeze and get really scared. I tried doing some training by increasing the amount I fall, but I get terrified once my harness is a couple INCHES above the clip. I know I won't fall a lot and I trust my belayer, so why am I so scared? Any advice on how I can over come this fear? I've watched videos but in practice it still terrifies me. Thanks, and happy climbing!

TL;DR: I fell 5ft on my back leading for the first time, now I'm terrified to fall. Any advice?  ",climbing

1107,Click Up Plus - Initial impressions,"I recently got the new Click Up Plus belay device and thought I'd share my experience with it so far.

---

**Some background:**  
I mostly top-rope indoors in a gym with a good variety in ropes (some are fairly worn 11mm ropes others are fairly new 8.5mm). I had the original Click Up before and have used the GriGri, Micro Jul and Atc plus before.

I prefered the Click Up for combining comfort, ease of use and assisted breaking. But given some of the thicker ropes in the gym, the original Click Up was definitely pretty hard work on some of the ropes (both for giving out slack and taking in slack). Lowering someone to the ground has always been an absolute dream on the Click Up; by far the best device for it that I've used.

---

**Experience with the Click Up +:**  

* Top Rope: Thicker ropes are much easier to work with. Even the thickest ropes in the gym are pretty easy to work with (this surprised me a little as the official difference is only .5mm). Narrower ropes are also fine and assisted breaking works perfectly on both.
* Lead: Minimal experience with lead so far, only a little on narrower nopes. But on narrower ropes it's mostly the same as the original Click Up (that is to say, smooth for paying out rope, easy to use and excellent assisted breaking).

Other notes; one other thing that's kind of been an annoyance with the original Click Up was that when hanging the device + carabiner off a harness loop it would sometimes get tangled and be somewhat annoying to untangle. This is still the case.",climbing
