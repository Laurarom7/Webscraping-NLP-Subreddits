2,I got stood up for a date at a climbing facility but it ended up being in my favor.,"Yesterday, I went to an indoor climbing facility for a date with a guy I was interested in. I thought it’d be a fun change of pace considering I’ve stuck to coffee and dinner dates by now. 

Well, not only did he not show up, but he also read my texts asking when he’d arrive and didn’t respond. 

It genuinely didn’t phase me. I’ve never become so infatuated so quickly with a sport before. I spent close to 4-5 hours climbing I enjoyed it *that* much. I tried out different auto-belay walls, made some acquaintances, and a lady at the front desk gave me a pamphlet about a youth casual climbing group that meets weekly. 

The positive environment was contagious. Staff was really helpful when I asked about different holds and routes and there was a group of little boys who SCREAMED their friends names when they finish a climb and make it to the top. It made me smile so hard. 

It was so fun, it completely blinded his rude move, and I plan on going next Saturday because it was that much fun. Perspective is everything I guess. I hope everyone has a great day and thanks for reading. ",climbing

13,Faulty belay device (MegaJul sport)?,"I got a MegaJul sport three months ago and since then I used it around 20 times only as an assisted belay device (I still rappel with a standard ATC).

Yesterday I noticed that the green plastic bit that connects the cable to the steel plate is a bit loose whenever I apply pressure on it. Loose means 1mm (see pic, normally the plastic is in contact with the metal), but I don't remember this being the case when new and I also wonder what happens when the device is loaded with a climber's weight.

I googled a bit and it turns out that some MegaJul did break in the past (see e.g. [https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/114338282/megajul-unexpectedly-broke-during-while-rapping-yesterday](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/114338282/megajul-unexpectedly-broke-during-while-rapping-yesterday)) exactly because of the cable coming off the plate.

My questions:

Should I retire the device (or am I being paranoid)?

Should I write to the manifacturer?

39,I have changed my view of progression to working V2-V5 downclimb beta instead of progressing V6+ at my gym. Anyone else do this?,"I am just curious if anyone else settled into this method of challenging themselves and would love to get a discussion going. As far as my rationale goes it can be summed up pretty quickly...

**I have never liked crimps.** 

Anytime I had to take a break from climbing to heal it was because of crimps and because of pushing progression. I always felt like a majority of the challenge in the V6+ realm comes from shrinking the holds and forcing crimps, which leads to finger pain, which can lead to a forced rest. 

I will work them sometimes, but I am not too attached to progressing in that realm.

&amp;nbsp;

**Two things have always stuck out from my research on finger strength and injuries:** 

* Muscles build fast (just think how quick you progressed once you started developing that forearm strength) 
* It takes years to build pulley/tendon strength (aka you get to V6 before your pulleys/tendons are ready)

What ends up happening is people get hooked and build that muscle fast which gets them to the high grades quickly. Then shit gets crimpy and they start to hurt or tear their pulleys/tendons ([usually the A2 pulley - some great visuals in this article](http://cruxcrush.com/2013/10/24/climber-problems-the-a2-pulley-strain/)). They either wise up and take a rest or push it to hard and blow a pulley. 

Either way they are out of commission. Apparently training on a hangboard can help, but the takeaway for me was always that the risk of finger injury just plain skyrockets when you get to crimpland. 

I never really wanted to develop a training/hangboard regimen just so I could do more routes with holds that I didn't like so...I didn't. Climbing was just my fun, consistent workout and avoiding crimps and consistent progression became part of that.

&amp;nbsp;

Eventually I started downclimbing routes so I could keep getting a good pump and breaking a sweat in my fun workouts. I pretty quickly realized

&gt; **""holy shit, this is two betas per route on all of the holds are ones actually LIKE""**

and have been doing it for some time now. Nobody else at my gym ever talks about downclimb beta though so in my curiosity I came to good old reddit.

Soooo yea, anyone else stop trying to go higher and higher on grades but **still challenge themselves by treating a downclimb like an actual route?** 

Downclimbing is obviously also a safe, knee and ankle preserving way to get off the wall which is nice, but I am really curious if anyone thinks about coming down as a route and challenge unto itself.


Cheers if you made it through this overly long post (I didn't plan on writing this much but it happened). Happy Friday!

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

I hate crimps. Crimps lead to hurt fingers. Hurt fingers mean I have to rest. Having to rest means I cant climb. 

I started avoiding crimps by staying below V6 and thinking of downclimbs as entirely separate routes, striving to be able to go up and down any route I like.

This is a long winded way of finding out if anyone else thinks this way because I haven't bumped into anyone at my gym that does.

45,Five Ten Hiangle alternatives,"Hi all,

​

I have been using five ten Hiangles for almost 1.5 years, and having been loving them as they fit my foot profile really well; however, the only drawback im finding is the heel cup as there is a small amount of dead space in it, so I am looking for some opinions on an alternative pair of climbing shoes.

I mainly boulder indoors, with an occassional outdoor trip, and I  don't have a chance to try alot of variety since I am from australia where we don't get a lot of variety in shoe brands, but I am looking into the evolv x1, scrapa vsr or scarpa v.

Does anyone have any experience with these shoes and confirm if they are similar to the foot shape of the hiangles, or can suggest any other pair of shoes that are similar to the hiangles with a narrow profile.

51,"Forearm popped, no pain though","So I was turning around a corner. My left arm was holding onto a nice hold, carrying some portion of my mass and probably a bit of my moment too, when I felt a peculiar ‘pop’ through the middle of my forearm. I, of course, stopped bouldering immediately. 

That was about an hour or so ago. I still don’t feel any pain, or even soreness (it’s just as sore as my other forearm... trying to get back into climbing after being unable to in the summer), but I’m still concerned about my forearm.

I retain full (painless) mobility of my entire arm, including wrist, fingers, etc. At the moment it happened, I had been climbing for a bit more than an hour, and had warmed up appropriately.

Any ideas of what the pop could have been? Should I be concerned? I’m in college, and tuition is a thing, so I’d prefer to stay out of a clinic if I can. Still, I don’t want to risk an injury. I’m thinking about giving it 3 days or a week just to be sure everything’s fuckin’-a in the grabber.

However, I believe fingers are completely different and I never know when a bit of pain is fine for climbing or if it could lead to a serious injury.

I started bouldering two years ago and I never had any particular pain, although recently (about 3 months ago), I started pushing myself with some more difficult problems like 6b+/6c. Since then, I started experiencing some pain in the ""flashy part"" of my fingers. It usually disappear completely after warming up, but it sometimes remain until the end of the training. When I'm not training, it also happens that a very specific movement of a finger, or a very localised area, feels particularly painful, like pinching my thumb and finger while holding my hand behind my back!

My question is, based on your experience, when should I start worrying, and what do you suggest doing when the pain a ""dangerous one""?

In 2015  I dislocated my shoulder whilst falling awkwardly out of a handstand, the shoulder fell back in without too much effort although later that day I re-dislocated it which took a larger amount of effort to relocate. After the accident I was advised by an orthopaedic surgeon to work on strengthening the ligaments and muscles around the shoulder, and surgery might be avoidable. Over the past three years at times it has left unstable, but I have slowly worked on physical therapy till now where it has been feeling almost pain free and feeling stable . Since starting bouldering I’ve worked even more on strengthening my shoulders, understanding the stress they are under due to the sport. This in mind, while on a wall last Sunday I’ve had my left arm extended at 60 degrees and crimped down hard next thing I know I’m lying on the mat with my shoulder dislocated. I was able to manipulate my body against the mat as I could feel it would go back in. My question; is there any possibility of recovering from this without a shoulder stabilisation surgery and continue climbing? Does anyone have experience or understanding of this procedure are there any risks involved such as loss of mobility or re-occurring problems?  Would surgery with physio along with stretch therapy result in the best outcome? Or should it be avoided?

I’ve had my MRI I’m waiting for the report and will be seeing an orthopaedic surgeon in the next couple days. Would really appreciate opinion on if a conservative treatment could work. 

Thanks for your time, 

Sorry i'm not sure where the most appropriate place would be to make this post.

95,Too old for this?,"I learned the basics of climbing when I was 17, in a high school gym class oriented towards the outdoors. Challenge Gym, it was called. We learned to climb, rappel, tie knots, make our own webbing harnesses, one-handed bowlines, and how to belay. I worked for a local outfitter for years, but it was a commercial operation , and I did not meet many people willing to share climbing with me. It was some special club I couldn’t join.


I haven’t done any of this in many years. I’m 42 now, I’ve had my kids and they’re old enough to climb and mountain bike.

In general I’ve felt like the outdoors community, despite its Welcome Everyone! Vibe, is anything but. I wasn’t born to climbing so I’m not welcome. 

And now, I’m too old, or so I’m told. I can Gym climb for fun, but I’ll never get on a real rock. Yes, a gym climber told me this. I should just view this as a workout.

Sp, how do I progress? I’ve been momming for over 11 years. Is my life of adventure over because I’m too old, missed my window?

105,Book training for climbing from Erik Horst,"Hello fellow climbers,

In my home gym they sell a lot of books including *training for climbing* from *Erik Horst*. When I was quickly scanning trough this book it looked quite promising in terms on learning new exercises and avoiding injuries overall. Now I have to say that i'm always really careful in training and read a lot of information on the internet to avoid injuries and train properly (I boulder approximately 2 years now). My question is if anyone has read this book and could give her/his opinion about this book for someone who is not a total noob about training/avoiding injuries. Moreover, if anyone has recommendations about other books on training please let me know in the comments :)

We didn't actually catch fire, but the building next door to us was so badly damaged by the fire that it's had to be completely demolished.

It's going to take us in total about a week and a half to clear up after the smoke damage. This is also going to include a reset of the entire centre as each hold has to soaked in Benky and then jetwashed to get them completely clean.

Some of the GB Climbing Team have very kindly offered to come in and help us reset this week, but it's still going to be a big job setting over 200 problems in 5 days!

The photo is what used to be our hold store, and you can see the demolished building through the hole.

For me it is purely a hobby, I am not even a good climber by any means, not internationally, not locally, not at my gym and not even among my friends, however it is still a big part of my life and my identity. This has led to numerous problems, for example fear of failure and even unhealthy amount of time spent climbing or training for climbing, to the point where I would feel frustrated to skip a training session to have a beer with friends.

This book will adrress many such problems and ways to overcome these crippling habits. I want to improve my climbing, I also want to have a healthier relationship with my favorite activity and I want to have more fun and less negative emotioms and thoughts when I am out climbimg, so I had a very open mind while reading this book hence it reflected greatly to me. I found many areas to fix on my approach to climbing and life in general with great tips and advices how to achieve that.

It is absolutelly great read that I would recommend to pretty much everyone who is willing to improve their lives or athletic performance. This is a climbing book so most examples are focused on climbing and most issues discussed are climbing related, but almost everything can be translated to any other althletic activity or life in general.

If you are new to the sub or new to yoga, WELCOME! There is an immense amount of information available in this sub, and an excellent community of people. 

If you have a question, PLEASE check out the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) and try search before creating a new post. As noted in rule 2, commonly asked questions are removed and directed to the above. 

**The updated version of the 'usual' sticky thread:**

This post is intended as a repository of pertinent info, including updates for new and ongoing issues. For the sake of visibility, we'll try to include links as pertinent.

**Reminders:**

* It's in the sidebar, it's in the rules, it's in the note when you create a new post. *PLEASE utilize search and the FAQ before creating a new post.* Especially around the first of the year, it's not unusual to see 3 versions of the same post in a day, asking questions that are well covered in the sub. If your post is removed because the answers are available there the mod team is not scolding you, we're just letting you know why it was done and reminding you that the answers you seek already exist. And yes, the mod team finds themselves busy doing just that this time of year. 

* /r/yoga is not the place for medical advice. This is always a handy reminder.
* **Addendum to the above** - Yoga philosophy and western medicine are different. There is room for both in this sub. This means that things like subtle bodies and energy (prana) movement and chakras *all have a place here* as well as discussion from a western perspective. There is no demand that anyone agrees with what is presented, but rule 1 applies in these cases- be respectful. 

* Yes, we have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/index) and [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) . (And they're awesome.)
The FAQ and search are the best places to start if you're new to yoga or have questions about styles, equipment, injuries, or resources. Plans in the works include a section for teachers, expansion of the section regarding yoga and other activities, and potentially an additional section for the questions that are common that to add to the FAQ would continue to grow an already large document. More FAQ updates will be coming, but in the meantime, we have continued to leave up questions that haven't been in awhile to keep more up-to-date information available when it exists.

* Yes, they're even available via app and mobile. Yes, really. (The sidebar, too!) It can take a little looking, but we haven't yet found an app without access to the sidebar.

* Reddit's guidelines are still the foundation of how we approach spam in /r/yoga, and bans will continue to be a thing as needed. Need the details? Reddit's guidelines are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

* This sub is not for market research. It's a community. Requests for the sub to tell you what we love or hate about our yoga mats and t-shirts will be removed, as will asking us to fill out surveys for that or your thesis research. Those are not the only such examples. When in doubt, feel free to message the mods ahead of time. Established community members can message mods ahead of time for permission on a case-by-case basis. 


**Other notes:**

* The automoderator is in use and working relatively well in terms of catching spam, and the mod team continues to monitor what is being automatically removed. Sometimes we catch them in the first 5 minutes, but sometimes it's a few hours between mod sweeps. If you've posted something that isn't showing up, you're welcome to message the mods (keeping in mind that it's possible it will be a bit before a mod sees it- please be patient!) and ask about it- including a link is much appreciated.

* Your mod team is human (you totally thought we were unicorns and rainbow-chasing leprechauns, but aside from cosplay and Halloween, not so much). Part of modding is making judgement calls, and sometimes we remove things that we can't be sure there isn't a bot behind that turns out to be totally legit because another real, in-the-flesh reddit user actually did post. :) Much like the point above, feel free to ask.

* The discussions on the Sutras have been collected on a wiki page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/sutras). Feel free to continue contributing to those threads as well as the current one. 

* As with the last update, COMP remains as-is. The mod team is done rehashing this topic, which will likely result in the posts questioning COMP that inevitably happen every time someone new finds them questionable being removed and referred to [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/search?q=COMP+self%3Ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;count=25&amp;after=t3_39saiq), until/unless the overall focus in the sub shifts substantially. For those unaware and interested, /u/BeyondMars posted [the following](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/48aaq2/should_an_individual_moderator_make_decisions/d0i424h) last time it came up to get everyone up to speed- here's the section on rule 4, to which I added the link:

&gt;&gt;&gt;   Search the history of this sub for discussions on [COMP] poses. [Probably two years ago now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1i9x4s/mod_post_state_of_the_subreddit_reminders_selfies/) There is a VERY LARGE part of this sub that doesnt wan't them to have a place here at all. The gist of it is that people come to reddit and dont want it to be like another yoga instagram, or something, I dont know. But there were portions of time in this sub when our ENTIRE front page was yoga pics. COMP was an effort to a compromise that would allow people to filter them out if they didnt want them there... In regards to the self-doxxing aspect. Sexual harassment, and online bullying have originated in this sub at least four times that I was made aware of. This rule was instituted to keep everyone safe. I don't care if YOU want your instagram accounts on the sub (self promotion?) but we are keeping people safer with this rule and the way we enforce it. Its going to stay. Take the extra 2 minutes and upload it to imgur.

28 June addition: 

It seemed obvious to the mod team when it was discussed a week or so ago, but for the sake of clarity, it's being noted here as well and will continue to be enforced, *especially* on COMP posts:

**Sexual/sexualized/objectifying comments are not welcome here. Removals are guaranteed, and warning vs. ban will be handled on a case-by-case basis.** 

Just don't. It all falls under rule 1.

I've been doing normal sit-ups and attempting to hold planks and locust poses for 20-50 breaths. Sit ups have been okay, but I really struggle with realizing the asanas that depend on strong back muscles and back bends correctly. Focusing so much on strength has also really affected my forward bends so I feel I need a more balanced asana progression.

165,How do you know you are ready to teach?,"Hello. I have been practicing vinyasa and hatha yoga for just over a year, and it has brought so much joy to my life. I'm more aware of my body, my thoughts, and my moods. I feel more gratitude and joy than I can ever remember feeling. It has greatly helped me cope with PTSD and I feel better than I have in years with minimal medication. I am so thankful to have my practice as a part of my life. One day, I'd like to teach others and share the joy I have found through my practice. My teachers have been kind, welcoming and encouraging. I've gotten physically more flexible and stronger than I've ever been, but honestly, these things are something of an afterthought compared to what yoga has done for my mind and spirit. 

My question is, to the teachers out there, how did you know you were ready to teach? What advice would you give to a student that hopes to teach one day? I am in no rush to get there and do not expect to become wealthy teaching, but it is something I would slowly and mindfully like to work towards. I have simply never found anything that gave me so much joy as practicing and sharing my practice with others. How can I deepen my practice in preparation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I know many studios would offer me teacher training right now, but I want to do this deliberately and organically. I want to know my heart is at the right place, that I'm truly in a position to teach and not merely showing others technically correct sequences of asanas. Your stories and wisdom would be greatly appreciated :)",yoga
166,HASH/WEED for Sadhaka - Let's put an end to this.,"Hey, I'm really trying to figure out what hash/weed's purpose is in Sadhaka. I've been getting so many different views on it, and still haven't been able to figure it out completely myself. I know that most Western Yoga Teachers are complete imbeciles when it comes to this question, because they will feed back the answer of a puritanical response, even though it is quite baseless.

Many tantras yes... they have agreed that cannabis is a proper addition to ones Sadhaka. So my question is this: Is hash really that deductive of ones Sadhaka, or is it CONDUCTIVE? Trying to figure this out... because I certainly do not trust Western Yoga Teachers when it comes to spirituality and philosophy regarding this. (they are best teaching kriyas.)

​

Some than have said that it generates too much 'wind' in the mind. Too much of that magickal element. I could see this, but than again, if people wanna get elemental - than you would just ground the energy and do a bout of yoga to level this out. Looking for a experiential view...

​

I do Ashtanga yoga and Kundalini yoga daily, both on and off of hashish. Have I felt it do be conductive? Can't friggen tell. I do my sadhaka with or without it. But i enjoy it alongside with it because it puts me in a state of mind that is far from the mundane... I follow the tantras and am close to shaivism. {where cannabis and hashish were traditional, as cannabis is a gift from Shiva, and plenty of information in the PERTAINING TANTRAS.

​

So... if anyone can help me resolve this conflict of information, that would be wonderful. Please someone shed light on why a Western Teacher - cut off from the heritage, must claim that this plant mustn't be imbibed. Is it ignorance on the Westerners parts?

173,Found my way back to yoga last night,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share some thoughts I had last night.  

I started practicing yoga in March of this year by following YWA's videos on YouTube. I started with her Revolution series and then went into True. Loved both of those! My shoulder hurt a little bit one day, so I decided to ease up on practicing every day. Well, I quickly fell out of practicing at all. The shoulder pain went away after a day or two but I just couldn't get back into it. At the same time, I was also going through a rough patch in my life. I knew yoga would help because I had been feeling so good while doing it but I was just feeling discouraged about a lot of things in life. Even though the shoulder pain went away I felt like what's the point of getting back into it if I'm just going to have to stop again if my shoulder starts hurting?  

I got into yoga in the first place because of lower back pain from sitting at a desk all day and this pain has returned since I stopped practicing yoga. So two nights ago I decided to start being more consistent (I had started Yoga Camp but hadn't gotten far). Last night I did Day 8 and it was exactly what I needed. The whole sequence was on the floor and a lot on the back (plus she said to grab a pillow, I love when yoga involves a pillow!) I loved it so much I found another random yoga for back video and followed that one too for a full hour of relaxing, peaceful, back healing yoga. It was the first time in a while I didn't care how long the video would be or how much time I'd have left before I had to go to sleep. I was just focused on helping my back to feel better.  

I think I'm going to focus on mostly restorative and gentle yoga for now, since that's what my body seems to like most. I'm only in my late 20s so it's kind of depressing to me to think I can't do the level of physical activity I want to do, but I know that's only temporary. I need to be kind to myself, take it easy, and listen to what my body is telling me. If my shoulder starts hurting again I'm going to go get it checked out. I hate setting up appointments with doctors or for anything really but I know it's important to take care of myself. I imagine a world where I'm not in pain and have the energy to do what I really want to do in life. I can get there but I need to give myself a helping hand.",yoga
174,Postnatal yoga advice?,"Hello! I’m cleared from my doctor and would like to slowly get back into my yoga routine. I’ve been doing simple salutations most days but need a longer flow sequence now. I would like to use online resources since leaving the house with my little guy is nearly impossible right now.

What is the best way to ease back in? I started slacking off around third trimester and am 2 months post partum now, so it’s been almost 5 months since I’ve really been practicing.

I’ve done yoga with Adriene and fightmaster yoga in the past. I feel like fightmaster is too fast and hard right now but ywa doesn’t quite do it for me. I dislike her chatter and really just need someone to help lead a guided flow.

I’ve tried some free flow but I think since I’m so out of practice right now I need a little guidance, plus I always resort to the same few poses and like the suggestions of things I don’t think to go to.

I guess I’m looking for suggestions for online classes/instructors and also any advice to get back into practice. I find it hard to get a long flow in (I’m usually interrupted within 20 minutes) so that has been frustrating. I keep telling myself any yoga is good. 

I’m really struggling with my body post partum. I feel so weak and everything is so tight. I would like to gain some strength and flexibility back so I can begin to feel more like myself again.",yoga
175,Extremely Tight Hip Flexors Causing Knee Pain,"Hi everyone!  
For some background- I'm a 27 year old yogi who's been practicing around 6 days a week for the past 3 years. Generally, I've always been very flexible and have had extremely open hips and loose hip flexors if anything. For example, lowering  hips down all the way in pigeon was a breeze, able to do splits, could sink deep in low lunge and it felt good.

A couple weeks ago I took 3 classes lead by a well known but tough yogi. I definitely pushed myself with a lot of strengthening core/hip flexor stuff but didn't feel any pain at the time. I did notice in the cool down of one class I could barely get into pigeon let alone sink all the way down because the contracted leg's hip flexor was SO tight.   


For a week after this I would try to practice regularly and I noticed both hip flexors were super tight and I was starting to feel pain in the outer edge of one of my knees at the same time. I've had sensitive knees in the past in certain poses but knew to back off and it would go away within a day or two... But this pain in one of my knees and tightness in both of my hip flexors could be felt when I was walking even not doing yoga.  


So I took a week break from yoga thinking that would help and I stopped noticed it while I was walking.. But coming back to yoga, now it's same thing. I'm trying to focus on stretching them out.. But still most open hip poses such as frog, seated wide leg forward fold, malasana, childs pose, happy baby I feel impossible tightness my hip flexors and some I feel the knee pain (I thought stretching it out would help?). Any closed hip flexor lengthening poses like low lunge and high lunge I feel the same.. This is even worse cause it's started to effect my low back as I'm arching it to compensate. Pigeon is a problem in the flexors of both legs as well.  


I have no idea really what happened or what I should do now. Is there something I should be stretching or strengthening that I'm not doing?   


If anyone has any experience with this or advice it would be so nice. I'm feeling a bit frustrated as a daily practitioner not being able to do stuff that used to feel good and easy in my body. Although I will say as a positive, it's going to help me grow as a teacher. :)  


Thanks for any help and sorry for the length!

1. Is going just once a week enough to see progress? I know I should try to go more, but i don’t really have much time unfortunately. I might find some online videos and try to do it another time a week on my own. 

2. Downward dog sucks. I have so much trouble. I’m just not flexible enough to do it right, so I’ve been doing some research on different modifications. Is the best way to just bend the legs and lift heals off the ground and make sure to keep the spine and arms aligned? 

3. Another thing regarding that, they do this thing where they lift the heals and go from toes then heal back on ground when in downward dog. Even with my knees bent I can’t really get my heel to the ground, should I just kind of pretty pressure back into my heel as much as I can, then back into toes?

4. Another thing was we did fallen triangle (I think that’s what she called it), and my arm was shaking a lot along with a few other poses. Is this a balance or a strength thing, so I know which I need to work on focus on to make it smoother and more comfortable. How long do you think it’ll take to be more... solid in this positions. 

5. Breathing. I always feel like I’m breathing wrong or out of synch with the movements she’s doing / the class. Is it okay if I do some transitions a little slower or faster?

This woman in the back row got up and started spiking blocks left and right going on about poor yoga etiquette.

I have mild scoliosis and I've suffered from back pain for a long time already. Lately I've been trying to make an effort to improve my health. I've tried to minimize my sitting time and improve my posture, been running regularly for a month, and yesterday I started Yoga with Adriene's 30 Days of Yoga series.

I could barely do most of the stuff for the first day, but I sticked to the end. I figured even if I half-assed most of the posses, I was still doing something and I'd eventually be able to do them properly, but today I had to stop half-way the 2nd day video because I couldn't do anything at all and I was feeling like I was about to collapse. i.e I can't plant my feet when doing Downward Facing Dog, and when doing the Half Forward Bend I can't get my hands to the floor without bending my knees and I worry that I'm rounding my back too much.

My main objective is to fix my posture, gain more flexibility and learn how to not round my back and do simple things like squat properly. My end goal is to have a good foundation for doing compound lifts, as I've always been interested in powerlifting, but I'm not able to do the most basic stuff with weights so I figured I should improve my body awareness and flexibility without weights first.

I'm thinking that I might just have a mental block rather than physically not being able to do those poses correctly, but I've been sitting most of my life so I think I'm just way too stiff.

2 weeks ago I went and signed up for a monthly membership at a local studio and since then have gone pretty much every day (11 times exactly) and have loved every part of it.

My point for making this post is that if you have been thinking about trying a yoga class but still haven't made it in...just go.  I'm a guy and was anxious about going the first time but once there I felt at home because everyone was so nice and welcoming.

I know classes may not be for everyone or maybe not in the budget right now but if you have been wondering and can fit it in the budget I think you'll really enjoy it if you just give it a try.

199,New to yoga &amp; wary of effects on spine/lower back (no pre-existing injuries),"Hi yogis.  I'd like someone to explain the rationale for certain yoga poses/movements for me, and I hope my wariness won't be taken the wrong way.  My partner, who is doing a PhD in spinal health (and has a degree in exercise physiology, and has been a gym instructor for over 10 years), has made me hypervigilant about protecting my back during any kind of exercise.  Basically he tells me that too much spinal extension is terrible, and that you should never twist laterally when in spinal flexion.  I've noticed several poses or transitions involve a fair degree of exactly this - spinal extension (e.g. cobra, upward facing dog, back bends - obviously) or twisting while in flexion.  Last night I did a class where we were encouraged to lie supine over a (quite large) bolster to 'protect the spine', which put us into pretty significant extension.  My partner was horrified when I demonstrated all this for him!!  So my question is:

\- have I gotten this completely wrong and we *shouldn't* be doing these kinds of movements in yoga?

\- is my partner just overly conservative and risk-averse (highly likely)?

\- if these things are really a part of yoga, how are such 'dangerous' movements justified, and how do you avoid injuries while performing them?

This has been my lifestyle choice for years, so it is no stretch for me to assure you that I won't blame you if your help or advice does not work or even if it makes me worse.  And my questions are very general.                 

I had a slightly collapsed disk with herniation and inflammation about 6 years ago or so.  It hurt like hell.  I had to scoot around the grocery store in those scooters for old and crippled people.  I was about 66 years old at that time.  I said at the time that I was going to heal myself.  I did.  I healed the inflamed part and the herniation part with many practices all piled together, including eating an anti-inflammatory diet.                

But now the collapsed disk is beginning to hurt and be inflamed.  It is nothing like what I went through 6 years ago.  That pain basically saved my life by forcing me to get hardcore about diet and exercise and health in general.                  

Now I am looking to yoga (and other things) to help with the collapsed disk.  I am fully aware that this time, being almost 73, I may not be able to heal it.  But I am going to try because it is my responsibility to try, for the sake of my family and for my sake.  This is my plan:               

Lots of folds, very slow, and held for like 3 minutes.  Is this a good plan?  Is longer better?  Do you know of anything else, yogic or otherwise, that would help me to help my capacity to heal, in particular to heal a collapsed disk?",yoga

221,Advice needed for improving staff pose,"Hi all,

I have recently started taking yoga classes, because I have lately suffered some injuries and want to get rid of my hypertonic pelvic floor. I noticed at the first lessons that I am very stiff in many areas and I notice this mainly at the staff pose.

​

[Staff pose](https://i.redd.it/mer5kpwcifi11.jpg)

I tried sitting on a bolster, with a folded towel and yoga block on it, but still my lower back is getting rounded. My sitting bones are pulled towards my knees. Is it good to start practicing this pose on the elevated bolster+towel+block level or is that still not the way to go because of the rounded lower back?

Is it possible that my extremely strong hypertonic pelvic floor influences this pose? Maybe that the pelvic floor muscle is also pulling at my sitting bones? How can I improve this pose or are there other poses which can help with this problem?

I also think i have some anterior pelvic tilt, which you can see on the most right picture. Can someone confirm this? Does this also affect the pose?

​

I hope someone can give me some instructions/advice for working towards an injury-free life :).

Thanks in advance, Mike",yoga

225,"Things Change, Practice Stays","Back in March, I was teaching hot yoga seven days a week and practicing for an hour every day. Even though asana is only one small component of yoga, I was appreciative of my physical practice and proud of what I had been able to accomplish over almost nine years.

And then in April, I woke up one morning with back pain so bad I couldn’t move. Out of nowhere I suddenly couldn’t even walk. I would drag myself onto the floor to do cat-cow and ustrasana, but my knees were so swollen I couldn’t do child’s pose and my back hurt so badly that laying in savasana was excruciating. 

I spent two months battling randomly swelling joints, periods of complete immobility, and the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. Finally at the beginning of June I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own joints, synovial fluid, and systems. I’ve since begun treatment and am starting to get some mobility and strength back, but I’ve lost nearly 60 lbs and am weaker than I have ever been. I also have nowhere near the range of motion I had back in March, and have pain or limited mobility in most parts of my body.

My practice has completely changed. RA saps energy, and one of its primary symptoms is extreme fatigue. I used to be in the hot room for hours at time. Now I do a few poses at home and take a break. I practice about 15-30 minutes at a time a few times a day. I take a weekly chair yoga class and gentle yoga twice a week with brilliant teachers. I focus on comfort, acceptance, and compassion for my body and mind. Practice exists to provide me with mental and physical relief from a disease that has taken a lot from me. It has been difficult not to be bitter about losing so much of what I worked for on a physical level, but I am starting to realize the beautiful things this experience has given me. When I am able to work again, I will be better equipped to meet my students where they are, and can reaffirm that this practice has so much more to offer than postures. It stayed with me through every moment of suffering and every moment of complete discouragement. I would practice pranayama to calm myself when the pain medication couldn’t touch what was happening, and I would meditate when my brain went a million miles an hour living in limbo and waiting for diagnosis. My practice was always there, maybe not in the form I wanted or was used to, but it held me up when I felt powerless.

Life changes fast. I’m living in what feels like a completely different body and mind. Everything is shaky and it feels hard sometimes to find solid ground. But when I practice, I’m home. It doesn’t matter how it looks or how strong I am. There I am present, I am whole, and I am well. Nothing can ever take my practice from me, ever. And that is the most comforting, reassuring thing I could possibly know in this moment. And despite how I did, I am so grateful to have learned that.

226,Trouble with DownDog and DD variations,"Hello everyone

I’m about 6’ 190lbs with muscular build. I recently discovered a love for yoga and have been practicing for a few months. 


I have had a lot of trouble holding myself in downdog. Even more difficulty with 3 legged dog. Doing knee to elbow touches are very difficult also. I get an overwhelming feeling of fatigue in my arms and shoulders though that is where I feel I carry the most strength. 


The instructors have all said my hands and over all form are good but I still just can’t get over how hard that pose has been for me.

228,I am the only guy in a class of 25 at my college,"I have way too many aches and pains for someone my age. I also have lost a lot of mobility in my knee and ankle from having a full leg cast a few years ago. I had a roommate who was really into yoga during my study abroad so I did it with him and some other guys and really enjoyed it. Also last year, I took a general fitness class at my college. One day for that class, we joined the yoga class for one of their sessions. There were at least 5 guys in there and even a football player. So when I signed up for yoga this year, I never expected to be the only guy. 

On our first class, I walked in and instantly felt that I should drop the class. I was the only guy in the room and felt so out of place. We didn’t actually do anything our first day other than talk about the class expectations. We did introductions and were asked to say what inspired us to take yoga. I made sure to be honest for my inspiration and say that I’m trying to rehab from some past injuries. I’m still concerned that I won’t be able to stay focused this semester during the class because I’m too worried about what other people think of me.

242,How long does it take to gain flexibility?,"So, basically I have been doing yoga for over 2 years now and still cannot sit up straight with straight legs, can barely do cobra some days, and my hips in bound-angle pose are about as far from touching the ground as is physiologically possible, just to name a few things. 

However, when I started doing yoga I didn’t really do it correctly (I believe) and not very often or long, but I have been doing whole-body stretching (not yoga) to increase flexibility, after warming up to prevent injury, for almost a year now p, as well as doing yoga on a far more regular basis for spiritual reasons, and even after stretching everyday (sometimes twice a day), and warming up properly beforehand I still cannot sit up straight in staff pose consistently (if I am full warmed up if I’m lucky I can just get my legs straight with a straight back but to get to that point it took about 9-10 months and in almost a year later it hasn’t improved by more than half and inch at best).

It’s like my muscles are scared to allow me more range of motion. I know that physiologically we all have different shaped joints and different connective tissue and ligaments, etc, but even if I am one of those people who will never be able to do a decent backbend or even the splits, surely I should be able to at least touch my toes?

Actually, the only progress I have actually seen (just slightly but still noticeable) is my shoulder mobility and overhead extension (my lats must be on my side, haha. No pun intended). 

You know, ironically, I’m able to flat-foot squat with ease (even with both feet together on good days), so I have no idea how I can do something like that when I’m about as mobile as a steel cable.
Literally, my hips and pirformis muscles are so tight I get knee pain (with flexed feet) when doing thread the needle, fire log pose (though not every day), and if I’ve been doing a lot of exercise my knees can hurt sitting in sukasana (cross-legged), but that’s only when I try to lightly stretch by leaning forward.

246,My journey with yoga (longer post),"Hello and namaste!

This is a post about how yoga helped me in my life, maybe you will find it interesting and helpful, I would also appriciate the feedback. English is not my first language, so I am sorry for any lingual mistakes.

About a year ago (age 27), I went through my worst depression period ever (not eating, not sleeping, not even moving much), I developed all sorts of anxiety disorders, I was really struggling to find myself as a person and thinking about how I have been living my life that led me to that moment. Before that time I was working as a software developer and I was finishing my computer science diploma, I had a lot on my back and was really tired and unhappy, so I spent all my free time smoking weed and playing video games, closing myself into a world that was smaller and unhappier each day. I was not hanging out with my friends anymore and did not have much interest in anything, my diet was so bad I won't even talk about that. I felt bad about myself and didn't know how to change things. I somehow managed to finish my diploma but it didn't make me feel like it was suppose to. From there things really started to go downhill, I got sick with some rare bacterial infection that crashed my immune system, which I think was mostly caused with how I was living my life. Because of this I lost my work, no one knew what exactly was wrong with my health and if am getting better anytime soon, so I got laid off. My girlfriend left me, she couldn't handle the state I was in and our relationship was non-existant. Everything led to somekind of mental breakdown, but with a lot of help of a few people I had left, I somehow managed not to do anything stupid and realized that I really need to change things about me and my life. The path had a lot of ups and downs and everything was really hard, especially at the start, but I kept getting up even when I lost all motivation, kept on going and learning. I was keeping myself busy and stayed by myself most of the time, sometimes feeling really lonely, yet I think the solitude had a big impact on everything I learned. And I must say I learned so much and it helped me to find out who I really am and what I really wanted to do in my life. I learned where I want to go and the most important thing is, I am healthy again.

So at first I realized I needed to start at the basics, diet, some kind of physical activity, calmness of mind that of course brings good sleep (I was refusing to take any antidepressants, because I think happiness should come from within the person not from a pill). Since I lost my work and I have somehow managed to finish my diploma, I had a lot of time to do an indepth research about this things. Diet was kinda of hard, since I lost all the interest for food. I started learning a lot about diet and food industry, to keep myself motivated to find meaning in eating food. I learned about how beneficial vegeterian diet can be for someone and I saw only good reasons in this, it seemed like the only logical diet for me. I started to slowly eat more because I knew my body needs the nutrients to function properly. I first came across yoga and what excatly yoga is (at that time I tought it was just some form of physical exercise), when I was researching breathing and meditation. Yoga tought me how noone should be hurt and for the first time in a long time I really felt good about myself, since I was working hard not to hurt anyone. I started doing breathing exercises and slowly developed a daily meditation practice which helped me to calm down my mind and I started to think and see things more clearly. I was also amazed with the yoga poses, especially hand balance poses. It looked really hard, but I wanted to do that one day. I started doing research on everything connected with controlling your body and bodyweight, this is where I found the similar aspects within yoga asanas and bodyweight exercises. I started doing exercises for full body strenght combined with a lot of asanas and slowly developed my exercising routines. I learned which poses I really enjoy and which poses I want to learn. After a few months of getting in better physical condition, I was already setting my goals for some advanced poses and here is where I realized how much time and effort I am putting into this and that this is something I actually really love doing, being active and staying healthy. I started running in nature and hiking mountains, which also had great impact on my mental state.

So here I am one year later and yoga now plays a great role in my life. I got my health back again, somehow my body managed to fight off the infection, no one really knows how, I am full of energy and I feel stronger as ever. I have achieved all my goals I have set for myself and even surpassed some, I now know that a lot is possible with the right mindset. I have decided on what I am going to do in my life because I want to do it and not care about what other people think, who I should be or what should I do. I am now helping an elderly lady with her everyday stuff which brings me some income to get me by and I feel really good about this. I don't do any work with computers anymore, I try to keep away from them, I don't care about how much money I can make and what I can buy with that, I will no longer stay on my previous path which I think was destructive for my life. I have met some wonderul people who I share interest with and I feel good and relaxed around them, I am thinking of doing a climbing course since I want to go to the mountains even more. In october I will start my first semester at a yoga school, first only practicing and after a while learning on yoga training. This is what I love to do, I love to be and stay healthy and I want to do my best to try and teach others about being healthy. I will do everything in my power to achieve this.

Here is a picture which shows how my outside look changed and I think it also represents the changes in my mental state. Left side is a about a year ago, when things were still really bad and the right side is now.

Thank you for reading. :)

EDIT:  I made a quick google document about my favourite asanas and how my routines look like for anyone who was wondering. It is missing the evening section of stretching poses (folds and bends), I will add that once I have more time, I will also update other sections if something changes. This is just how I like to do my routines and I also advise you to find and develop your own favourite asanas and routines so you will keep doing them consistenly. Asanas are mostly written in Sanskrit, I prefer it that way so I can learn the names.

I was walking to the bus stop yesterday after having a great slow morning involving yoga after a two week break. I felt so fucking good. Like too good to be true good. It’s like being high. The high that comes with taking care of yourself, of being in your best physical and mental health. A long-term high, created from investments rather than consuming something. There’s nothing like it. The clarity of mind you acquire, the peacefulness, the pleasure of being in your body...  

Thinking about this because last night I drank quite a bit and relapsed because I was drunk, smoking five cigarettes over the night. Today, I feel like getting intoxicated really kind of undoes that healthy natural feeling very quickly. It’s like I gotta get back into the swing of things and recover.

I’ve been doing yoga on and off for a couple years, and I’ve never had this problem until I had been practicing more regularly recently. Anytime I go into a table or down dog, my shoulders are KILLING me, and then hurt for days after. I do have scoliosis, although it has never been a problem in any other exercising I have done. 

Are there any warmups I can do or different ways to hold these poses? I don’t want to have to give up to save my shoulders!",yoga

265,One injury leading to another?,"After having some muscle spasms in my traps due to overtraining, I went to my doctor. I also had some tightness in my chest muscles. This seemed to be causing some thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms. She said to hold back on the harder sports I was involved in but keep stretching and doing yoga. My traps are slowly getting better.

But, in trying to correct my posture, I seem to have irritated some other muscles in my upper back, shoulders and glutes. I switched to a standing desk and now I'm getting some tightness in my glutes and some sciatic nerve compression symptoms in my legs that comes and goes (calves and shins get cold and tingly). Also, my left forearm is now cramping and is also cold and tingly.

2 weeks ago, she said to come and see her in 4-6 weeks if I wasn't any better. I'm on the verge of going back next week. My symptoms are much better on the weekends when I'm not working at my desk job all day.

Gave yoga a go to stretch out my legs and core to help with recovery and prevent injury. So far I’ve seen massive improvements. I hurt less after running,  I cycle faster and I just feel a lot looser. And then there’s the added benefit of the endorphin high which is much greater from just a short amount of stretching over what I’d normally get after a long run/cycle. 

When I do camel pose I keep getting cramp in my lats. I can prevent it by not breathing so deeply. The muscle is quite relaxed (or not being stretched at least) so I’m not sure what’s going on. 

I’m guessing either my form is off, although I’ve recorded myself doing it and it looks more or less ok, or my lats need strengthening. Maybe they’re tensing up to try and keep my body stable.

Anyone got any advice on what is best to do to fix this? Should I just keep at it and hopefully be able to hold it longer without cramp? Or should I  work on back strength?

310,I need some guidance to choose a style,"First and foremost, hello and thanks you for taking some time to read me and help me.

So I’ve been doing yoga on/off for more than a year, it then became what i did during active recovery days. But I went through what I would call a “training crisis”. I didn’t know why I was weight lifting, why I was running or why I was doing calisthenics. I felt like it was wrong, that it wasn’t really me. I mean, I did enjoy sport and physical activity, but I had done these things over and over for more than 3 years, and my practice did not evolve as much as I did. Eventually, I did stopped doing everything except yoga, which was the only thing I still enjoyed, and it was in line with my goals.

So I started doing Yoga nearly everyday, sometimes twice a day thanks to the downdog app, it felt great, I felt great afterward, everything was fine. But I tried to deepen my practice, I knew a bit about yoga styles, but not much, so I tried to learn more about most styles. Two styles in particular pleased me:

* **Vinyasa:** what I started with, and what I still enjoy a lot. I love the fact that the class is really flowing, each movement leading to the next one really is something I enjoy. Overall I felt great, improved quite a bit and thought I was getting a good workout overall

* **Ashtanga:** ashtanga is amazing in principles, I love the fact that it is rooted in yogic principles; that it follows a tradition, I love doing Surya Namaskar A and B plus the fundamentals postures, I love this moving meditation and I love the community. However, I really don’t like the series. I mean it doesn’t seem to be a balanced at all (but I may be missing a point). On the top of that, I feel like apart from the Surya Namaskar, ashtanga isn’t flowing that much for a Vinyasa style, and isn't way more flexibility focused than what people say.

So here is my problem: I can’t decide which style I should focus on. I really like the physical aspect of Vinyasa, and I really like the philosophy of Ashtanga, but I don’t seem to be able to ally both. What do you think I should do?

(while re reading the post it seems like some ashtangis could think I'm attacking them and their favourite yoga style, which believe me isn't my intention at all, I actually love your style and find most ashtangis really inspiring)

EDIT: I understand too that Ashtanga isn't supposed to be a workout but a moving meditation, it's just that I'd like both.",yoga

319,New Shoulder Issue in Down Dog,"I'm new to this sub--hoping one of you fine people can give me more answers than my yoga instructors.

I've been practicing yoga for about 6 years on and off but got much more serious about it in the last year and a half.  Downward dog has always been one of my favorite postures as far as a feeling of balance and well-being, that is up until about 6 months ago.  Something in my left shoulder seems to be blocking my arm from achieving the proper external rotation.  You know how when you rotate externally and pull your shoulders away from your ears, it gives a sensation almost like you can feel your joints going deeper into themselves? Well on the left side it's like it gets painfully stuck and unable to go as deep.  Pain runs right along the top of my shoulder.  I don't feel it in forearm balances or dolphin pose, or even in plank.  Only in downward dog and sometimes in triangle.  It's highly frustrating as the pose now makes me feel lopsided and stuck whereas before it was a place of engagement and relaxation to return to in my practice.  I spoke to my yoga instructor about it and she brushed it off, saying I probably just had a little asymmetry in my body (not true, didn't have it before!), and that I appeared to be doing the posture properly and well.  Any insights into what might be going on and what I could do to remedy it?

323,A birthday gift for a yoga instructor / girlfriend,"I appologise if I'm trespassing with a silly question.

I was recently introduced to yoga by my new girlfriend who happens to be a certified yoga instructor. Her birthday is coming up very soon and since yoga is a huge part of her life I figured it would be nice to get her something related. As a complete beginner I'm afraid to get a tacky or useless thing. 

She teaches / practices at two different places and at home. I'm concidering getting her a watercolor yoga mat (http://dvayoga.ru/d/860821/d/akvarel_yogamat.jpg). Perhaps 4mm version. Maybe with a different picture. Is it a good idea or is it tacky and unprofessional to have a painted mat? 

I also have other options... One is a bonsai tree, but she has a cat which will probably destroy it at once. 

Please let me know if there's something you'd love to receive as a gift. Something with meaning. A fun activity for the day is organised, but I'd like to get something lasting too. 

I realise it's not exactly a yoga question, but I'm sure almost everyone here has a yoga instructor, so it might be a useful discussion. Thanks everyone. ",yoga

328,Side crow question,"Hi all! I have a question about side crow. I’ve tried to figure it out via Google but I keep coming up with mixed answers. Hopefully someone can help. 

I’m really just wondering if your legs are meant to be resting ONLY on one arm, or if they can rest along both triceps. 

In a recent class I took, the instructor had us place our legs along both triceps, (of course with both knees pointing in one direction). But today, a different instructor had us balance our legs on one arm, leaving no part of our body touching the other arm. Does anyone know what the proper way of doing this pose is? ",yoga
329,Trying to pinpoint hip mobility problem,"What a great sub! I’ve been practicing various forms of yoga for years and am interested now in improving poses by understanding the mechanics of my body better. My biggest issue is a specific tightness of my hips in one direction - they don’t want to rotate in any way that lifts my leg up and to the side. This is most noticeable in frog pose - if I keep my knees bent only 90deg and my feet flexed, I can barely open my knees as wide as my mat before they just seem to stop. I can sometimes breathe and move slowly back and forth enough to settle a couple inches wider, but this has not improved much over many years of practice. I have decent internal/external rotation otherwise, but tight hip flexors and poor glute activation  that I am working a lot on. 

Any ideas on what I can work on to open my groin/hips/whatever is going on more?  ",yoga
330,How to feel about teacher being repeatedly late?,"Hi everyone!
So my absolute favorite yoga teacher - who is always amazing and whose style really suits me - is almost always 5 to 10 minutes late for class, and I don't know how to feel about it. On the one hand I know that Ivm always calm and satisfied at the end of her classes, regardless of their length, and since she is such a good teacher I won't stop going to her classes anyway. On the other hand it feels a bit disrespectful on her part and I can't help feeling irritated about it at times, which isn't a very nice starting point for a class. I have been thinking about notifying the studio about the issue so they maybe can speak to her and/or make adjustments to her working schedule as to give her more time between classes. I don't however want to risk them sacking her or her being offended /fed up and deciding to quit. She seems very genuine and present when she is teaching, but I also do pay good money for the classes and it feels a little bit like I'm systematically not given my money's worth... 

Any suggestions on how to go about changing this situation? Or should I just work on myself and my own reactions to it?",yoga
331,Recently experiencing intense energy while doing heart opening stretch. Normal?,"I don't actually do yoga but am not sure where else to ask this question. I felt what I experience as some energy stuckness in my chest and stomach and recently began giving it a good stretch. I spread my arms out wide, arch my back, and push my chest and stomach out until it feels a little uncomfortable and then hold my breath at the top of the stretch for 3-5 seconds before exhaling and returning to my normal posture. During of after the exhale I often experience a disorienting, but mostly pleasant, feeling that is difficult to describe. It feels like an energy release that puts me very much in my body and my thoughts often completely stop altogether for up to a minute. At it's most intense I lose awareness of my environment for a few seconds. The experience can be quite intense sometimes and I have to make sure that I am near a place where I can sit or lay down when I do this now because I'm afraid it might make me fall over.

334,Yoga for the flexibility challenged,"I’m sorry if this was in the FAQ but I couldn’t find anything particularly on this topic. I’m not very flexible but am trying to get into yoga. For example, when I reach straight down I can maybe reach halfway down my shins on a good day. I recently went to a yoga class and it seemed like a lot of the poses assumed you had a certain amount of flexibility. I couldn’t do a lot of the things because of that. I was wondering if there is any poses or type of yoga that doesn’t require as much flexibility so I can work my way up. Thanks for your time. 

TLDR I’m not very flexible and want to find a way I can get into yoga without being left out of some of the poses. 

Edit: Wow! I’m overwhelmed by everyone’s response. Thank you guys so much for the insane amount of advice and support. I really appreciate it.

339,Tight hips after hot yoga?,"I’ve been going to hot yoga vinyasa classes about three times a week for the past six months and have noticed that my hips have been getting tighter.  

I took ten days off a couple of weeks ago and noticed that the tightness in my hips was completely gone. I’ve since returned to class and the pain is now back.

I initially thought it was other exercises I was doing that was causing the tightness (running, cycling, circuit training), so thought the yoga would help release the tightness in the hips. My husband also goes to the classes and is noticing the same kind of thing. 

Is it possible for hot yoga to cause tightness in the hips? I feel like maybe because your body is so warm, it’s possible to push harder than you really should and cause injury/strain.

I get into each of the other poses easily enough, including the shoulder stand (currently holding for 5:30) and halasana (holding for 1:45). But when I come out of halasana I find it nearly impossible to flatten my back. I need to add in several twists and/or bridge postures before I can feel comfortable lying flat.

I assumed I might have too much of a bend in my back during halasana but I’ve tried videotaping myself during the pose and I think it looked pretty normal. Are there any other common pitfalls I might be experiencing, or other things I might be missing? Has anyone else had this trouble?

But neither during the earlier breathing exercises or the cool down at the end with the cloth could I keep my eyes closed. They were either twitching uncontrollably or open. I could not rest them. 

I thought it may be anxiety about being in an open, public space, but it isn't like I felt self conscious or unsafe. Is this something that comes with practice? With time? Am I the only one that struggles with this?

I don't think I've closed my eyes much during my home practice, so I can't say if it was a surge of energy from the practice or if it was because I was out of my element. Either way, the twitching was bothersome and not being able to rest them was distracting and took me out of the desirable head space.

372,Discussion: Yoga with aphantasia (inability to visualise),"Apologies for the lengthy post, a lot to unpack here.

My background:

I've been doing yoga for 20 years, teaching for 13, and always struggled with anything that involves visualisation. In my practice I favour meditation based on nirguna approaches (emptiness, mindfulness) rather than visualisations.

Aphantasia:

Last year I found out that I have a disorder called aphantasia. I'm completely unable to form mental images. At all - I can't even visualise my daughter's face, and I saw her two minutes ago. In the general population there's a spectrum, with people varying in their ability to visualise. I think those most affected are about 1-3% of the population.

I didn't know I had an issue until I happened to read about it, and then spoke to some psychologist friends. I assumed that everyone else was being metaphorical when they said they could mentally visualise things. But it turns out you all can!

Impact on yoga:

I don't think this is a problem for my practice, and in some ways it helps - I'm never disturbed by imagery or sounds in meditation, though my thoughts do still wander. But it has made me realise that I've probably not taught visualisation-based techniques as well as I could have, so I'm working on that. I usually stick to the templates my teachers taught me for those anyway, so I shouldn't be too far off (and they're usually very well received by students).

Questions:

Has anyone else ever encountered this, either themselves or with students?

For those of you with mental imagery (still seems bizarre to me), how do you feel that someone without that might be affected, either personally or in terms of teaching?

Reflection:

I think its absolutely wild that something so fundamental could be so hidden from me. In a way it feels like a small example of self-realisation in my own life! 

But for teachers out there, do think about how this might affect some of your students. ",yoga
373,What’s wrong with my legs?!,"I am a pretty flexible person, and I do yoga tapes regularly. I can do some of the advanced moves, go pretty far in stretches, etc.  I have decent balance in most poses. All in all, I’m progressing nicely! 

But, I have trouble with this one odd thing!

In a forward bend, standing or seated, I can nearly put my head to my knees and easily grab my feet with my legs straight. 

BUT...

If the pose involves me sticking my leg straight out (with the exception of half moon), I CANNOT get my legs straight. It throws me completely off balance to try. Think of poses like...downward dog split, standing split, boat pose, or recently a pose (don’t know the name) where I was basically in tree pose and they had me stick a leg out and hold my toes with my fingers.

I get that holding a leg out vs. sitting is different, but it seems odd I have quite this much trouble. 

Do I need to be more flexible? Or have more muscle in my legs? Or both?

Recently got interested into yoga. Bought a mat, but here is the problem i am facing.

Due to my room, my yoga matte is paralell to the TV, so i have to turn my neck around all the time and see which pose did she move to now. + she uses a lot of words that i am not familiar with. 
3 week yoga retreat - they are just doing it too fast, like they think you know what will be the next yoga pose and while you understand you need to switch, you are rushing into it, which becomes more of a cardio than yoga.

380,I need encouragement.,"Sorry for the long post but i have to get this off my chest..

So, maintaining a regular yoga practice has been a goal of mine for over a year now. I have had lower back/sciatica issues on and off for many years. My pain would come and go but a while back it came and did not go! I was in significant pain every day. I tried chiropractic care which helped some but didn't get me very far. I decided to incorporate yoga into my routine for both the physical and mental benefits. I started small by getting myself acquainted with yoga using videos online. Once I had the confidence to join a class I started going three times a week. I felt great on the days I had class but I didn't really see a big enough reduction in my daily pain. My Chiropractor suggested that I go for an MRI which I did. I found out that I had two bulging discs in my back that were putting pressure on my spinal cord and no amount of yoga or chiropractic care was going to fix that. I needed surgery. So I had the surgery and went through the recovery process where I couldn't lift or do any real physical activity for over three months. Once that period of time was up I went through physical therapy. I have since been released from physical therapy and am on my own. My pain is gone for the most part aside from some soreness and tension.

381,Question about Downdog App and difficulty levels,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been doing yoga off and on for a couple of years now. I quit when is started playing rollerderby and started weightlifting. But my body needs some TLC so I found my way back to my daily practice. 

I reallly do enjoy the Downdog app, but I’m very confused about the difficulty level of the app (or anything yoga related really since it’s not really linear). Is there some sort of baseline of poses you need to be able to do to before you can say; “Ah Yea, I’m definitely intermediate 1!”

387,Advice needed to practice on the trail,"Hello everyone, fairly new yogi here. This is my first post. I’m an avid backpacker (the camping kind) and I would love to incorporate yoga into trips. I’m about to go on a 6 night trip hiking ~10 miles a day and I would love to do some yoga daily, to stretch my tired legs but also to stay active in my upper body and maybe avoid t-rex arms.

I tried some yoga on a similar trip earlier this summer, and I even guided my friends and it was fun. We only did a few poses but it inspired me to want to do more with it. My dilemma here is that I’ve only been consistently practicing for about 8 months now and I’m an Adrienne junky. I pull up a Yoga with Adrienne youtube video every morning to practice and they’ve pretty drastically changed how I feel for the rest of the day and I love it. Her guiding words help keep me focused and allow me to really lose myself in the practice, and it’s very meditative for me. However, when I’m in a situation where I don’t have access to youtube, I’m sort of at a loss what to do, I can’t keep focused and I can never come up with the poses I know I know.

In short, these are my questions, and I’d love your advice:

1. What poses/series of poses do you recommend for someone hiking for many days with a pack in the woods?

2. How should I remember these poses? I’d like to practice for at least 20 or 30 minutes and my brain fizzles at the thought of it.

3. This isn’t super specific to my backpacking situation, but how can I grow my practice to transition out of being solely reliant on a guided video while still keeping my mind clear and the overall experience meditative.

Thank you in advance :)",yoga

389,Feeling awkward as the only guy in class,"Particularly, there's this class called buti yoga which I like. It's a mix of dancing and yoga. It's cool because I find myself smiling a lot more. A few ""problems"" exist. 

1. I'm not a good dancer at all, so I sometimes feel funny. But that's not too big a deal. Part of the fun is getting past that fear.

2. I'm the only guy, so I worry that the girls there will be annoyed by my presence. I feel like I'm intruding. So even if my intentions are mostly pure, if my presence annoys the others then perhaps the right action is to not go. 

3. Sometimes I can't help but 'admire' the great dance skills of those around me. I will try to solve this by moving to the front of class. But then 1. More will see my bad dance moves and 2. I won't be able to see the instructor.

At the end of the day, I think I'll go regardless because of how much fun the yoga is, regardless of how others may perceive me. Just wondering if anyone has some insight..",yoga

403,"Pronunciation of ""namaste""","It's pronounced ""nuh-muh-steh"" not ""nah-mah-stay"". It might seem like no big deal, but it really bothers me. As we all know, the word is Sanskrit and has a lot of meaning. I feel like it should be pronounced correctly to honor the language, the culture of India, and the word.

What if people pronounced Ave Maria ""ayve-mariah"" or went to France and said ""bon-jower""? I feel like it's disrespectful. 

What are your thoughts?

Edit: blows my mind and makes me sad that there is so much resistance to even trying to say an ancient Sanskrit word that has deep meaning correctly. You don't need an Indian accent. You just need to try, because trying shows respect. 

If I said Buddha ""bud-ha"" and a Buddist corrected me and said it's ""bhud-thuh"" and I said ""boo-duh"" because that's the closest I could get to, it's better than will fully saying ""bud-ha"", knowing that it's wrong. 

Now imagine that millions of people insisted on saying ""bud-ha"" and told the Buddhist to chill out because it's just a word. Namaste isn't just a word like cat or dog. It's said at the end of each practice for a very special reason. 

The vast majority if people don't know that they're saying it wrong; they're saying it as they were taught. It's possible to fix that.

410,"Why do I go into ""twilight zone"" after teaching a class?","Hey yoga people

I have been dabbling with the yogic &amp; vedic culture for around 5 years, but am a relatively new teacher. I still get nervous before every class, but when I do get on the mat, I seem to get this unexplainable concentration that I usually don't have when practicing solo. It's an inner zone where everything in the world is in the right place and I feel like some of my students can feed on it.

But the thing that is troubling me, is that after I close the class, I'm left in this zone of inner contentment and am unable to be sharp enough to deal with outer reality, as it seems somehow unimportant. I can answer a few questions from the students with ease, but after that I have the need to go relax in silence. I feel so blissful but at the same time incapable of handling basic material things. Today after class I rolled up my mat, and then just forgot it in the hall as I went straight to the beach outside to enjoy the nature. Luckily some of my students spotted it and brought it for me. I was so absorbed it didn't even cross my mind that there were some material ""belongings"" to take care of.

It's such a double edged sword, because obviously, being content feels great but at the same time I feel like a dementic in the real world. It usually balances out after a few hours and I feel normal, but was just wondering if any of you have some insight on this? Thanks.

411,Developing flexibility and making structural changes.,"I though this would be a good sub to try and discuss this idea.

I have never been a flexible person.

In my younger days I was an athlete. I have always been very coordinated and strong. I did years of track and football through school. I was a backpacker and rockclimber for much of my adolescent and young adult life.

But I was never flexible.

I've never been able to stretch with good form and flexibility has never been a priority for me.

Now that I'm in my 30s and managing some long term pain with a stretching regiment, I realize that I'm trying to make some serious biomechanical changes to my body. I'm actively damaging muscles and tendons so that they can heal stronger (and, in this case, longer).


*So*,

I had a motorcycle accident 19 years ago which left me with an incomplete quadriplegia.

This had however affected my upper and lower limbs, particularly my left hand side a well as bladder, etc. Movement is possible but with walking aids and very short distances, and I use a wheelchair which someone else has to push dude to limited upper body strength.

I have always worked, often to the detriment of my physical health and would like to improve my mobility specially now that I have become a father. Having tried loads of different things, loads of physio, I attend the gym 3 to 4 times per week where someone helps me, I feel I have run out of options. Due to my lack of movement I keep putting on weight (3 stone/20kgs/40+lbs) this year alone.

There has been a video circulating online for a few years with an ex parachuter who recovers in 6 months using yoga.

Well, a few weeks ago I started doing daily YouTube yoga. I didn’t even start to help with pain, but to help with anxiety and as a fun exercise routine. I very quickly realized how good it felt to stretch out all the tightness in my body. It also felt sooo great on my back.
Within 4 days I noticed a huge difference in my back pain. I wasn’t complaining to my bf as often or asking him to rub it, and I no longer felt the need to take the pain meds.
3 weeks later, and I almost never feel pain in my back. The exception being for a few days during my period.

442,Asian Games Women's Final recap,"They started the day with speed. This was my first time watching a full speed comp start to finish so I wasn't sure wth was going on, other than that the person who tags the thing at the top first wins. I thought they were going to just rank athletes by time, but they did a full set of head-to-head races to determine the 1-6 rank. The rankings after the speed round was:

Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points

Lee | 3 | - | - | 3
Ito | 4 | - | - | 4
Kim | 5 | - | - | 5
Noguchi | 6 | - | - | 6


The bouldering round really separated out the competitors. On F1, Lee and Marlenova couldn't even reach the zone(bonus) hold. Kim had trouble with F2 because of her height. F3 was a big disappointment on the setters because the beta was broken. Everyone who topped F3 used the zone hold only as a foot; they didn't even bother to tag it with a hand just for the bonus point and instead just took it to the top. Marlenova was the only one to not top this, and she touched the zone hold with her hands when she tried to dyno to it out of desperation. F4 was similar. The setters probably wanted the climbers to sideways-dyno into a double-gaston. No one did that, and instead just went straight up. This put the climbers in a weird spot where they had to basically downclimb a move to tag the zone hold, and a couple of them almost fell doing so.

Kim | 5 | 3 | - | 15
Lee | 3 | 5 | - | 15


I don't know how tiebreakers work but whatever rule they use, Kim beats Lee, so Lee went first. This was 4th day on climbing for these athletes after 3 straight days of quals. They all looked tired. Lee fought the pump as much as she could before falling around halfway up. Marlenova was clearly already out of gas towards the end of the bouldering round, and ended up only making a handful of moves up the wall. Kim took it to the top like a champ. She didn't look that tired either. The final move to the top hold was a dyno and she caught it with room to spare. She probably knew this guaranteed her a medal as she got a bit emotional celebrating at the top. Ito made good progress until her knee popped and she fell. I got a little uneasy watching them climb this route because there were lots of tweaky-looking heel hooks - those that you bring your foot up to your waist height and your leg goes sideways horizontal. Ito was in the middle of a leftward cross move with her right leg in this position and ended up getting injured. She was clutching her right knee as she got lowered and remained on the ground even after getting lowered. She had to get carried out on a board. Noguchi looked like she had a pretty good chance of taking it to the top as well but looks like the fatigue finally caught up to her. At this point, Sa was guaranteed a silver and needed to best Noguchi's position for the gold. She looked like she was well on her way until she fell just about where Ito fell. I think she made a mistake and slipped. Sa herself looked pretty disappointed as well.


Climber | Hold

Final standings :

Ito | 4 | 2 | 4 | 32
Marlenova | 2 | 6 | 6 | 72
Lee | 3 | 5 | 5 | 75


I still don't know how tiebreakers work because Noguchi won gold. I thought Sa would win gold based on her first place qual finish but I guess that's not how the rules are written. Also, 2-6-6 looks worse than 3-5-5 but again, that's just how the points are calculated.


The men's finals will start in a bit but I won't be watching that as I have other things to do. My guess is Tomoa gold, Chon silver, Kokoro bronze.",climbing
443,Massage therapy and climbing?,"Hey all, any massage therapists out there? I’ve been thinking about going to massage therapy school, but I’ve heard that the work is really hard in your hands/arms, and I’m worried that I wouldn’t be able to climb anymore. Or, alternatively, that climbing has messed up my hands already to the point where massage would be difficult in the first place.

444,Advice for building mind-body connection?,"I've been a desk jockey my whole life. Due to life circumstance, I was never exposed to sports or really physical activity much at all and used video games as escape, and eventually my career. Luckily I never got significantly overweight, but I was never active or in shape and my hand-eye coordination is good only in as much as a mouse and keyboard is involved. If you asked me or my family you would have just said I was ""never into all that active stuff"".

​

In 2018, my life goal has been to change all that, because I didn't think it was true - just circumstantial. Earlier this year I trained for a 10K and started heavy weight lifting - hating the former but expanding the latter to 5 days a week. I've gone out hiking, kayaking, and I bike almost every day. In May, I started rock climbing, and fell in love. As of today I'm in the best shape of my life, I feel strong and capable in ways I didn't know possible (but with many years of gains to be had). I've been extensively reading articles and books on climbing as well as the two reddit climbing forums.

​

Obviously I'm still very very new and there are tons of ""noob gains"" to be had by ""just climbing"" (which I do as often as my body allows, which appears to be more and more). But I can tell I'm being hugely held back by two things: lack of trust in my body to perform and lack of mind-body connection, and I would like some advice on how to improve these things, especially from people who have overcome them.

​

I'm very cerebral and in my thoughts a lot (also have moderate-to-severe ADD). Awareness of where my body is in space and what it's doing is usually very low, and I am currently putting most of my training effort into watching/focusing on my body parts (feet, core) to make sure they're doing what I want them to do. In my normal life I'm very clumsy and bump into things, trip, and knock things over all the time. I suck at throwing/catching things and am just generally ungraceful.

​

More importantly, I just don't trust my body. I am often observing these minute hesitations in my daily life for things that I assume I can't do, and I have to remind myself to at least give it a try (ex: lifting my weight to climb on top of something, picking up a heavy thing, leveraging something that is stuck). In climbing, I frequently notice that I won't instinctively try to stand up on a hold because I don't think my legs can do it. I SUCK at reaching holds that require a big push into a grab because the confidence isn't there, and I do a wimpy attempt and peel off after hanging around below the hold for several seconds agonizing about how I won't be able to do it. Logically, I know I \*could\* do it. But I'm always pre-convincing myself that I can't. I'm reading The Rock Warrior's Way now and I feel like I'm doing basically the opposite of everything he recommends. I set myself up for failure by looking at things without objective framing and without confidence. I see everything as being too hard, too scary, above my level.

​

How can I unlearn a lifetime (30 years) of believing I'm weak and incapable? Do you have any advice for how you developed confidence or equanimity in a rock climbing setting, especially for formerly lazy uncoordinated gumbies?",climbing

459,"Any training tips for an older, not very strong but lean person new to climbing?","I work at a climbing gym and have taught beginner lessons and coached kids climbing teams for a little over two years now. I’ve also read numerous books on training and done training programs myself. However, recently I taught a private lesson for a person that I just described in the title, and it’s a little difficult for me because he is not able to do the same exercises that kids or young adults are typically able to do at a beginner level. So far I’ve had him do pull-ups using an assisted pull-up machine(taking off a lot of weight), and done some relatively easy core-work like knee raises because he can’t do sit ups or Russian twists or anything like that.  He knows a good deal of technique but most of the time he doesn’t have the confidence in himself to try things that I suggest while he’s climbing on the wall, so I think that if his strength is increased he will have more confidence in himself while climbing. The only problem is that the supplemental exercises that I’m used to are too difficult for him. Do you guys know of any exercises he    or other  people like him(maybe overweight people or other older people) can do to build a strong fitness base for climbing? ",climbing

465,The Asian Games are underway. Quals are over.,"I rarely watch plastic climbing comps but I'm stuck indoors, it's hot AF outside, and this was on TV anyway. I caught a bit of the bouldering quals and a good chunk of the lead quals. Speed quals were already over. Because I don't watch plastic comps I'm not aware of any other comp that has adopted the Olympic-style combined format yet. At least for me, this is a good pre-run to see how that format will play itself out on a larger scale. What's weird here is that there is a medal for speed, medal for combined (lead+boulder+speed), and a medal for speed relay (not sure how this even works) but that's just the Asian Games. The Olympics will only have the combined medal.


Here are the [men's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-men-combined/) and [women's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-women-combined/) after quals. The scores are calculated by your rank in each discipline multiplied, with the lowest score winning. We'll have to consider that the level of competition here has huge disparity. That being said, there's a big gap between the podium and those outside. Top 6 made finals. Not surprising to see that the two Japanese and two Korean climbers get four spots, then someone else fairly well-rounded (Au &amp; Lee), and someone who blitzed up the speed wall (Khaibullin &amp; Marlenova, coincidentally both from Kazakhstan). It seems like the way the points are calculated, unless you really shit the bed in lead and boulder, winning speed will get you in the finals. I wasn't sure how I felt about it initially but after seeing the table, I'm okay with a ""discipline winner"" basically getting a spot in the finals. 


Finals are tomorrow and they're starting with speed. No indication on which of lead or boulder will be next but if they follow the quals order then it'll be boulder first. I'd be interested to see how the single day finals will turn out logistically for the climbers. That's a lot of high-intensity, high-stakes climbing to do on your 4th day on.",climbing

503,"Finally pinpointed the cause of my achey fingers and swollen PIP joints... and it was belaying, not climbing!","Wanted to share my story in case anyone else is suffering. I'll try to keep it as short as possible!

Background:
I have been experiencing some pain and swelling on the fingers of my left hand, focused on the joints rather than the pulleys. During a recent climbing trip it got pretty bad, and I realized something was really off when I couldn't fully close the fingers in my left hand while my right was normal. 

This was frustrating and perplexing because I always warm up thoroughly before climbing, avoid excessive crimping and sketchy pockets, rest often, and take really good care of my fingers on days off. I assumed it was an overuse thing and took a few days off in hopes it would calm down. 

Realization hits:
After a few days off climbing and lots of finger warm ups on the hike in, the first 3 warm ups felt pretty good. On climb 4 my partner tried something harder and took a long fall. As usual, I got lifted off the ground a few feet, but ascended the rope as high as I could so he could boink back to the route. The moment I gripped the rope to pull up on my gri gri, the pain in my left hand came back in full force. It hit me that this was probably the cause and I decided to do a little research. 

After talking to some experienced climbers in my community, I found out that gripping the rope like this puts a lot of force on the collateral ligaments of your joints. This is apparently NO BUENO but it explains my symptoms perfectly. The collateral ligaments are not strengthened by climbing like our pulleys are, so they are very sensitive to injury.

Proposed solution:
The first thing I did was stop ascending the rope and in just a week my left hand already feels way better. However, ascending the rope is still essential when belaying on steep routes, so I've ordered an ascender and will see if that is more comfortable for my joints.  

If anyone has had a similar experience I'd love to hear about it!

TLDR: Recurring pain and joint swelling on left hand (ring and middle fingers). Figured out this is from ascending the rope after catching long falls while lead belaying. No longer ascending rope by hand (instantly alleviated symptoms) and will be trying out belaying with an ascender.",climbing

Yesterday I received 2 pairs of Shadows, 9 and 9.5.  Althought I only traversed for 5 minutes with the 9s, I decided not to keep either one.  Main reason:  they just look cheaply made.  You can see glue residue all over the shoe, kind of like when you glue something on a piece of paper, have put too much glue, and glue comes out when you stick the thing down.  Also, the fit was just plain weird (I understand this is a very personal thing, but still thought worth mentioning):  the mouth of the shoe is very small, so you struggle to get your foot in, not because the shoe itself is tight, but because your foot doesn't fit through the mouth.  Once on, the shoes felt very tight midfoot down, and very big midfoot up.  Also, the heel had a lot of air.

My 2 cents... obviously some people out there love the Shadows, just not for me, and wanted to share.

519,Cracking fingers: supplements or other tips?,"Hi folks, apologies if this has already been discussed but didn't see anything too similar.
I've been climbing for about 6 months, bouldering indoors twice or three times per week. My finger joints are often slightly painful in between climbs. I've noticed my knuckles crack a lot more than they used to, and it's a bit disconcerting.
I've been using a stretchy plastic ring device for exercising my fingers, opening rather than closing, as I was under the impression this was an appropriate exercise for generally strengthening the ligaments and supportive tissue. But it's not really helping so far (albeit only a couple of weeks use).
I'm kind of worried I might give myself some kind of arthritis, eventually. 

I wondered if anyone would recommend something like cod liver oil or another supplement for joint health. Is this something that's likely to help? Or any other tips really.
Thanks!

526,Broken Talus (Ankle) Bone,"Last Sunday I slipped on a slab at my local bouldering wall, and my right foot unfortunately hit a giant jug close to the ground before I landed on the mat. As I have hypermobility in my joints and the foot had essentially done a 360, I assumed it was dislocated. Big shock when the X-Ray came back and the nurse tells me I have broken my talus bone. I should find out tomorrow exactly how bad it is and whether I will need surgery. For the time being I'm non-weight bearing; I was too short for the usual armpit crutches, so I'm making do (poorly) with elbow crutches, hopping about with extreme cabin fever.

All the broken talus bone stories I read on the internet are dismal, and I'm terrified. I only started climbing 10 months ago, and I've fallen in love with the sport - I ran track, fell and cross country previously but never felt the same passion or drive to train as I do with climbing now. Emotionally I struggle when I can't exercise, so the next six months to rest-of-my-life will be tough.

Can anyone give me some hope for the future? Even if you had a rough time with a talus break, is there any way you can put a positive spin on your story for me so I can at least have some belief I will recover? I'm a fit 20 year old female, I only fell from about two metres and I don't weight very much (very short). Do these work in my favour? Will I ever get back to the same level of movement again?

569,Tracking climbing volume/ V Points for lead climbing,"Hello all,

I could need some advice on how to track my climbing progress, especially regarding to training volume. I used to track the time spend at the gym only but found this doesn't really mean much. Sometimes I belay much more than I climb, sometimes I spend 30min on one crux, sometimes I speed through lot's of easy climbs in that time.

I like the idea of the V-Points in bouldering where you (my understanding) add up the points for each boulder but don't really see how to apply that to rout climbing.

We use UIAA scale in my gym, but I feel just adding up the grades won't work. Climbing an 8 should ""worth more"" than 2 5's in my opinion.

Any thoughts on this, or maybe someone already has come up with a points system I could use?

Meeting with the Doc

The urologist explained that I needed to go into this knowing it was not a reversible procedure.  He said that even thought it is reversible, it sometimes is impossible due to the anatomy.  After he inspected my junk, he said I was a good candidate for having the procedure done right there in his office.  There is the option to go to a hospital, where they would fully sedate you, etc, so you CAN do that if you want.  The way I had the procedure done was $500, and it was covered by my insurance.

Without getting too technical, he basically explained make a small incision, find each tube, and for each one (there are two), he would cut the tube, tie it, and cauterize it.  He explained the whole thing would be about 15 minutes, and that the only painful part would be when he clamps and pulls the tubes out so he can do his thing.  He said the pain would be very similar to getting kicked in the nuts.  I have never thought I would feel happy about basically paying someone $500 for kicking me in the nuts twice.  The main thing that stayed with me from this consult was a question he asked me: ""how many kids do you have?""... he didn't ask ""do you have kids?"" ... They need to make sure you are fully committed to this, so once I explained to him our reasons why, I was good to go.  In my research, I read about some doctors making their patients attend a ""class"" to ensure that's what they want, or flat out refuse to do the procedure... makes sense.

Day before the procedure

Not much to say here other than I manscapped EVERYTHING, and wanted to wait until the day before so it would be nice and fresh. :)  This is something that needs to be done, so if you don't do it yourself, someone will do it for you... I wasn't cool with trusting someone shaving my balls (but somehow I was okay with someone cutting them open... hrmm).

V-day

I went into the room.  I was asked to take off my pants, and lie on a narrow bed.  About 5 minutes later, a female nurse came in and put iodine all over my stuff... it was very, very cold, and yes, it tickled.  Before the iodine, she took 3 strips of, what looked like to me but I'm sure wasn't, masking tape, and she taped my penis to my stomach (to get it out of the way for the procedure).  I know, weird.  A lot of thoughts went through my mind at this moment... thoughts that I will not share here, but you can imagine some of them, I'm sure.

After about 10 minutes of being in the room with my pants down and the cold iodine just getting colder, the doc came in with 2 female nurses.  Hmm.  Ok, whatevs.  He asked if I'm ready... ""any last words?"" he says.  I say no, and he starts.  He used a small needle to numb where the cut was going to be... this didn't hurt at all.  He made the incision, which I did not feel, and started moving stuff around in there.  I could feel stuff moving inside (imagine noodles being moved around, I guess).  He pulls a section of the first tube out, cuts, ties, and cauterizes (I couldn't see, he was talking to me the whole time).  The only part where I felt ""some"" pain (probably 2 out of 10) was when he said I would:  when he had to ""look"" for the tube.  As he told me he was basically done with the first one, I see smoke come up from down here... yes, I saw, and smelled, my balls being cauterized.  Again, no pain during any of this.  He said he was going to try to use the same incision to find the next tube, which he was able to, and basically repeated the first half it all over again.  Before I knew it, it was done.  THE WORST PART of this whole thing was the anticipation of that sharp ""getting kicked in the balls"" pain, which never came... I was afraid I was going to feel the pain hit me, and buckle or something, but nothing.  A mild discomfort here and there, but that was it.  I had my hands over my forehead the whole time, and during the second half of the procedure, I was actually starting to fall asleep a little bit.  He stitched me up, and I was on my way out, on my feet.

The following sections are directly from my phone, as I took notes daily for a few days after the procedure:

V-day:  currently in car.  Pain is similar to the pain that resides after getting kicked in the balls.  3 out of 10.  Throwing up feeling.  Home.  bag of frozen green beans over underwear... doesn't help with pain at all.  7 hours after: no pain.

Day 1 after procedure:  absolutely no pain.  Did I even get anything done?

Day 2:  slight pain, but very milkd (1 out of 10, if that).  Same pain as if shit had been mangled down there, which it technically was.

Day 3:  swollen a bit, no pain.  Interesting feeling walking with balls bigger than what you're used to.  Belayed my friend for 3 hours, then traversed at the end of the gym:  ALL GOOD.

Days following until yesterday:  no pain, swelling going down daily.

Today (9 days after procedure):  I just came back from the rock climbing gym, where I had a full hard session.  Normal warm up, an hour plus of hard bouldering, and 45 minutes of endurance.  Absolutely no pain at all.

The only thing that resides is a slight discomfort when I jump up and down, as if jumping rope... that's it.  I have a follow up this upcoming Friday.

This is all!  Please feel free to ask any questions about the procedure, private message me, etc.  I think vasectomies are a taboo subject, and they shouldn't be.",climbing

674,Obscure request: Gym rec's with great auto-belay routes? [US specific],"Hello all.

I am a fairly new climber, but I often travel for work (sales) so I find myself in random cities on a regular basis. Since I am usually solo on my trips, I often pay for day passes at nearby climbing gyms to have a few hours of fun. Being a solo climber, I'm limited to auto belay routes and bouldering.

The crowd here seems to be well dispersed, so I was hoping anyone could chime in with recommendations for climbing gyms (within the lower 48) that have particularly interesting or challenging routes with auto belays.

I can usually tackle 5.9-5.10 routes, so I'm always on the lookout for routes in this difficulty range that present a nice challenge.

My hope is that there are some gyms out there that have particularly high routes (beyond 40ft) or varying pitches (within reason, given how an auto belay works).

Thanks in advance.

707,Getting over fear of falling?,"Hi, sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. I've been doing indoor top roping at my school's gym for the past two years. A couple months ago I was learning to lead and the first time I got on the wall I slipped and fell off like 5 ft up before reaching the first clip and fell on my back (yeah, we should've had a crash pad but it slipped our minds). Ever since that fall I've been terrified of falling while leading. I can easily and happily fall while top roping and sometimes my friends will do a ""rollercoaster"" and lower me super fast and I'm not sacred. I can lead comfortably routes much easier than I top rope because I know I won't fall, but the second someone tells me to fall, I freeze and get really scared. I tried doing some training by increasing the amount I fall, but I get terrified once my harness is a couple INCHES above the clip. I know I won't fall a lot and I trust my belayer, so why am I so scared? Any advice on how I can over come this fear? I've watched videos but in practice it still terrifies me. Thanks, and happy climbing!

TL;DR: I fell 5ft on my back leading for the first time, now I'm terrified to fall. Any advice?  ",climbing

Having color coded hand/foot holds made the whole process a lot easier indoors. It made me have a new appreciation for those that can climb hard outdoor routes. I can't imagine climbing one of those 5.9+ routes that were at the same site. Anyways, it was a ton of fun and I really want to make it out to more outdoor climbing locations!

754,Click Up Plus - Initial impressions,"I recently got the new Click Up Plus belay device and thought I'd share my experience with it so far.

---

**Some background:**  
I mostly top-rope indoors in a gym with a good variety in ropes (some are fairly worn 11mm ropes others are fairly new 8.5mm). I had the original Click Up before and have used the GriGri, Micro Jul and Atc plus before.

I prefered the Click Up for combining comfort, ease of use and assisted breaking. But given some of the thicker ropes in the gym, the original Click Up was definitely pretty hard work on some of the ropes (both for giving out slack and taking in slack). Lowering someone to the ground has always been an absolute dream on the Click Up; by far the best device for it that I've used.

---

**Experience with the Click Up +:**  

* Top Rope: Thicker ropes are much easier to work with. Even the thickest ropes in the gym are pretty easy to work with (this surprised me a little as the official difference is only .5mm). Narrower ropes are also fine and assisted breaking works perfectly on both.
* Lead: Minimal experience with lead so far, only a little on narrower nopes. But on narrower ropes it's mostly the same as the original Click Up (that is to say, smooth for paying out rope, easy to use and excellent assisted breaking).

Other notes; one other thing that's kind of been an annoyance with the original Click Up was that when hanging the device + carabiner off a harness loop it would sometimes get tangled and be somewhat annoying to untangle. This is still the case.",climbing

No matter the country or the origin of the people I always, always hear lots of people saying ""Allez allez !"" in French. Now as a French I can clearly tell that most of the time it's non-french who use it (due to the accent) and I was wondering why is it used so much everywhere ? (I even remember hearing japaneses use it!) ",climbing

763,Croatia Climbing?,"Hi guys!

My boyfriend and I are flying to Pula, Croatia and are driving along the coast to Split. We've got our eyes on some DWS spots in Pula but looking for any recommendations you guys may have, if anyone has first-hand experience of bouldering/climbing in Croatia.  
Also maybe worth noting we'll be wild camping so any tips on that would also be awesome.

Thanks so much :D",climbing

766,Osteoarthritis in big toe?,"Read a couple posts here about big toe soreness, but didn't find much that can provide solid help

First off, haven't seen a doctor yet but I have an appointment scheduled next week. Anyways, started to notice about a month ago some odd pain/soreness in the big knuckle below my big toe. Sometimes after climbing, but not specifically. Would normally subside after a day or two, but lately its been very sore to the point where I have to alter how I walk on my right foot.

So, has anyone been diagnosed with osteoarthritis in their big toe? I've read a few things to do that can help the soreness (incing, anti-inflammatory meds, light stretching).",climbing

773,Training for climbing without gyms,"Hello friends,

Im somewhat far from a gym, about 2 hours away, and i was wondering if anyone had tips for breaking grades while not climbing like a gym rat. I have thought about getting a hangboard but ive had many people tell me i'll probably die since ive only been climbing since November. 

I'm currently climbing 11+/12- and v4/v5 outdoor. I haven't really trained at all yet, just climbed like a mad man. Is it possible to train without spending time on plastic? If so does anyone have any reccomendations on what i do?


Edit: I just wanted to add that im extremely curious about finger strength training. Ive noticed that hard v5 and v6 problems often incorporate hard movements on small holds. Im confident that i can increase my fitness on my own, but im mostly interested in climbing related strength (i.e. finger strength, coordination movements, and mental training).",climbing
774,"After a three year hiatus for the peace corps and readjustment period, I've started climbing again but it's kicking my butt.","I've lost my muscle (whatever little I even had) and my technique is WAY off and my calluses peeled off years ago.  I know we've all been at square one at some point,  but it's really disheartening and I'm questioning whether or not to keep trying or move on now that I'm nearing 30.  

Ya'll have any words of encouragement or tips for making the pain (physical and mental) less depressing? I used to love this sport, but I've lost touch with the community and need some kind words from people who understand.

775,What rope for climbing photography?,"Hi, I'm getting into climbing photography and wondered if anyone had any advice on what static rope to get/what to look for in a static rope. Specifically:

1. What width? I emailed Sterling, who recommended 10mm for durability's sake. I'm unfamiliar with how much the teeth in ascenders wear down the rope, but that's what I'm looking to avoid. It'd be nice to cut down on weight if the 10mm is unnecessary, though.
2. What length? I'm imagining as long as my climbing rope (70m). (I hear some people rig the base of their static line away from the cliff (e.g. on a tree) to get them away from the rock, which would imply a rope potentially longer than the climbing rope is necessary, but it seems unlikely I'll be both in this situation and be photographing a 70m route. 
3. What brand/model? I have 100' of Sterling HTP that I use for static anchors that I like, so I was looking at that, and also Mammut Performance Static rope (love their infinity/eternity dynamic ropes). But I'm open to anything, especially because there are companies that make static rope (e.g. Imlay) that I've never heard of, since they don't make rock climbing gear.",climbing

781,Older cams safe?,"My dad was a climber in the 80s and 90s and has about 10 cams. They were only placed once or twice and never fallen on. They look brand new but I am apprehensive about using them. With the current price of cams being so high, do you think these are safe? I don’t have the money to buy anything new right now, but I won’t use anything that is unsafe. 

EDIT: Finally got back from U.K. and found aforementioned cams. They are Wild County brand and are in nearly new condition. They are in need of a new sling but there is no rust, frayed wiring, or any visual issues. If anyone is still interested there is a photo below. Thanks for all the help regardless.

It has *so much* fantastic climbing - bouldering, sport, or trad - with a killer local vibe and some impressive, bold ethics for route development. Come prepared to pucker up and leave those bolts far behind if you're climbing sport; most of the routes here are bolted ground up, in stance, *with hand drills*, so they aren't shy about running out the 'easy' parts. If you're ever taking a trip to Devil's Tower, set aside some time to make this a part of it.",climbing

I'm headed out to Greece at the end of September, and I'm looking for somewhere with a similar setup if there is one. I'd rather not pay extortionate rates for full-on schooling, but just some assistance since I'd rather not have to bring along a full sport rack.
