0,What rope for climbing photography?,"Hi, I'm getting into climbing photography and wondered if anyone had any advice on what static rope to get/what to look for in a static rope. Specifically:

1. What width? I emailed Sterling, who recommended 10mm for durability's sake. I'm unfamiliar with how much the teeth in ascenders wear down the rope, but that's what I'm looking to avoid. It'd be nice to cut down on weight if the 10mm is unnecessary, though.
2. What length? I'm imagining as long as my climbing rope (70m). (I hear some people rig the base of their static line away from the cliff (e.g. on a tree) to get them away from the rock, which would imply a rope potentially longer than the climbing rope is necessary, but it seems unlikely I'll be both in this situation and be photographing a 70m route. 
3. What brand/model? I have 100' of Sterling HTP that I use for static anchors that I like, so I was looking at that, and also Mammut Performance Static rope (love their infinity/eternity dynamic ropes). But I'm open to anything, especially because there are companies that make static rope (e.g. Imlay) that I've never heard of, since they don't make rock climbing gear.",climbing

59,Resling or girth hitch old BD camalots?,"Hi there,

I recently acquired some fourth generation BD camalots such as in the photo below (fourth cam from the left). It does not have a thumb loop, rather just a metal ring through which the sling goes.

84,achey shoulder after climbing,"For the last 2 months or so I have been getting this sort of dull ache on the back of my left shoulder (thinking like teres minor/infraspinatus area). It doesn't ""hurt"" per se and there is no apparent loss of mobility or strength. It just doesn't feel right. It seems to come and go, occasionally radiating a sort of numb feeling down my left arm/hand.

It began after a hard gym bouldering session in which I was repeatedly (10+ times) doing a very long left hand reach to a jug on a steep overhang. The move basically had me fully weighting my left arm while it was stretched out very far. I can see how this movement could have caused me to pull one of my posterior rotator cuff muscles, as I was not ""plugging in"" my shoulder while weighting it.

Anyways after it did not go away despite taking it easy and avoiding overhangs for a couple weeks, I took a month off climbing completely. During this time, I got some resistance bands and have been doing rotator cuff exercises daily. This has seemed to improve my overall shoulder stability (which is slightly wonky due to a shoulder separation about 5 years ago), but today was my first day back climbing and the feeling is the same as before.

Anybody have any experience with symptoms like this? Additionally, what type of doctor would I go to to get it checked out? I have a very good PPO through work, so I can skip the GP and go straight to an orthopedist or PT if needed. Unsure though whether a PT is able to order an MRI or diagnose a more non-healing injury like a SLAP tear. But also unsure if an ortho is overkill for something that doesn't even really hurt.

UPDATE: Seems like the time off helped after all. To summarize, I took about 4 weeks off climbing completely. During this time, I did [these rotator cuff exercises](https://imgur.com/gallery/1TihDvf) (2 sets) daily. Near the end of the time off, I also started doing some light shoulder press (8x3 @ 10lb dumbbells) at the gym. I have felt a definite increase in shoulder stability and strength, as well as a reduction in pain/soreness after climbing. I will continue to do the resistance bands daily as I figure it is beneficial and takes very little time if you just leave a set of resistance bands set up somewhere in your home.",climbing
85,Help finding a truly round stock carabiner,"**TL;DR** I need a carabiner whose spine has a circular cross section. Does anyone here own one of these?

[Sterling Osprey](https://sterlingrope.com/store/work/hardware/carabiners-snaphooks/osprey)

[Trango Regulock](http://www.trango.com/p-231-regulock-hms-screwlock.aspx)

[Metolius Element](https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/element_belay_carabiner.html)

**Extended explanation** I have a Mega Jul belay device and I love it. It works great for belaying lead or top rope, and I haven't had any trouble rappelling either. However, all of the reviews say that guide mode is shit, and I can elaborate on that.

Guide mode on the device is shit when you're using a carabiner with a modern I or H profile. It tremendously increases the friction on the rope causing the difficulties the reviews all mention. I also learned that the profile makes lowering inconsistent and jerky.

I had a much better guide mode experience when I tried using my 10mm quick link in the rope loop. This comes with it's own problems though: a) it's a lot of heavy steel that I don't need for any other purpose on multipitch trad, which is where I'd be using guide mode and b) quicklinks aren't large enough to use as recommended by the manufacturer with the gate inside the wire loop.

I tried a BD Rocklock locker for it, but the spine is not round and if you use it the long way with the smooth side on the device it's too large to fit in the belay loop.

Hoping that someone has experience with some of the ones I linked.

&gt;Inb4 ""get a grigri"" or ""buy a reverso/atc guide."" I like being able to dual strand rappel and lock off on the same device.

&gt;@Edelrid, you guys really should produce carabiners that actually suit your device.

Edit: to clarify, if you took a knife and cut through the carabiner on the side opposite the gate, and then looked directly at where you cut, for a round stock biner you would see the metal is shaped like a circle. In most biners that shape would be an I or an H depending on your orientation.",climbing

91,Back tightness limiting grip strength,"TLDR: Years of lifting and climbing with no stretching gave me super tight back muscles. They started impinging on my nerves and making it impossible to grip things. PT/stretching has helped, but only partly. Does anyone have any experience with this/advice? Also, if you don't stretch, you really really should!


I started climbing a couple years ago, after spending a lot of time lifting. I had very bad upper body mobility, although I didn't know it at the time. About a year ago, I started to notice that my grip strength in my right hand was noticeably weaker than my left, and I got pumped almost as soon as I started a climbing session. As this became more noticeable, I thought I needed to get stronger, so I started hangboarding more, and it kept getting worse. This culminated in tingling and numbness in my right hand.


At this point, a doctor diagnosed me with Carpal tunnel, which was wrong. A month later, I went to PT, where they gave me some stretches and things immediately started to improve. I could literally feel my nerves reactivating in my hand as a stretched my back. 3ish months of PT and very consistent stretching has helped immensely, but I think I've plateaued. If anyone has dealt with anything similar, I'd love to hear your stories. I'm back to bouldering at a V5/V6 level, and I can climb 5.11ish, but I'm still getting pumped really fast in my right hand.",climbing

101,I made an Android app for calculating climbing fall forces,"Hey there climbers!

I made [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jahepi.whipper) for Android that allows you to calculate the forces that appear on a climbing fall.  For those not on mobile, the app is called Whipper - Climbing Falls.

The idea of creating this app comes from wondering how much resistance actually is 22kN on a carabiner, or how much forces do we create when falling on our protection gear. I'm a climber with a nerd side so I did a bit of reading and then I first made an Excel. As I'm learning programming I decided do create an app about it. Some friends liked it so I thought maybe it could be interesting for more people.

Spoiler: Gear is bomber and usually you will break the stone where protection is placed before the protection piece. It's safer for our gear falling 10 meters when you already climbed 30 meters than falling 2 meters when you climbed 3 meters. This shouldn't be something new for you but here you can check it.

The app is free, it doesn't have any advertisement and weights only 1.6M. It has a Spanish and English version, and metric or imperial units. If you were wondering about this, no, I don't get any profit from this (I doubt I could haha)

I'd love if you gave me some feedback on the design, usability, or any error you could find. And also, typos and specially gramar and vocabulary mistakes on the English version (I'm not a native English speaker).

Any other suggestions will be welcome too! If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer.If you are more interested on it or if you want to collaborate with me, PM me. :)

Last question, what do you think about the name?

Cheers!

**EDIT:** Since many of you asked how the calculation is done, I will explain it here when I get some time.

As it has been said below, there are several ways of predicting this values and they all have similar, but different results. In any case, I picked this one because it is not too complicated to understand for any user and you don't need a huge process to get all the needed information.

This is complicated. there are many others factors involved as the weight of the belayer, humidity or dynamic or static belaying that are not considered in this formula. So the result may not be as precise, but it's easier to use (Who climbs in a lab anyway?) :) I'll finish this explanation later, I'm going climbing!

**\***If you feel curious, you can make a comparison with the [the values found by Petzl](https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Forces-at-work-in-a-real-fall), you'll see they are pretty similar but a bit lower.

106,Buying a rope?,"I have found some great deals on 70m Beal ropes for \~90€:

* 9.5 mm Zenith
* 9.8 mm Karma
* 10 mm Virus
* 10.2 mm Antidote

I use BD ATC-guide as my belay device and have 12 quickdraws. Which rope, or which thickness would you recommend me? I climb mostly outside in crags.

Thanks a lot! :)

Local crag stats:

* 5-9 m : 27
* 10-14 m : 46
* 15-19 m : 13
* 20-24 m : 7
* 25-30 m : 1

I could easily do with 50 m rope in the local crag, but that closes the possibility to go multi pitch climbing elsewhere, or I would have to borrow a rope from someone...

Should I instead opt for a 50 m rope for some \~ 70 €? It would be lighter and more practical to carry, but less versatile.",climbing

In the second case, the climber started climbing but a couple of feet up the retraction mechanism failed, creating slack and negating the device's fall soft catching ability.  The second incident didn't result in a fall or injuries.  Both gyms confirmed they respected the vendor's maintenance &amp; inspection schedules.  Still, 2 failures seems like a lot...",climbing

130,Which Yosemite Guidebook,"So, I have a week long trip planned to the Valley in November. We are planning to do lots of single day multi pitch climbing and some cragging. I need a guidebook. The problem is I am having trouble deciding which one. I have done some research and based on internet comments this is my understanding of what books are available and the pros and cons of each.

* The Supertopo Book: Pros: excellent approach and descent beta, has plenty of climbs to keep you busy for a week. Cons: older, some information may be dated, less detailed topos

* The Reid Guide: Pros: tons of climbs and excellent topos. Cons: older, some information may be dated, less approach beta than supertopo out of print so can be expensive. 

* The new book (Sloan): Pros: new, comes with a free app. Cons: heavy, filler information, not enough detail in the book itself. 

My first question is: has anyone used the new book with the app? if so, is the app any good? does it make up for the stated shortcomings in the book? Is the app any better than just supplementing the supertopo or Reid guide with Mountain project?

Secondly, does anyone who has spent extensive time in the Valley and seen all three books have a recommendation for me as to what to do? I definitely do not want to buy all three books, but I am open to buying two if it will keep me from getting super lost looking for climbs or getting stranded at the top looking for the descent. 

Edit: for anyone else wondering which book to get for the Valley, the conclusion I have come to based on this thread is as follows. Start with the Supertopo guide and supplement with mountain project. If you think you may out climb that book, there is a comprehensive guide in the works by Clint Cummins, Ed Hartouni and Eric Gabel. It will have similar coverage to the Reid guide, and they have put in a lot of work to verify route beta, so it might be worth waiting for that to come out before buying another book so long as Supertopo is still keeping you busy.",climbing

- yoga classes 3-5 times a week, and often I’ll jog 5 miles once a week in place of a class
- classes are in a hot studio with infrared, and include HIIT cardio segments

I feel like losing about 10-15 pounds more will increase flexibility, balance, endurance, etc. But losing weight is getting harder with age 🙄

I exercise so much that I get depleted when I don’t eat enough. To be able to work out, I eat a significant amount of calories. Most of my intake is through fish, nuts, avocado, and high fat dairy. Some gluten free grains. Not much meat. 

I wonder if increasing carbs through fruit and grains will trigger intense cravings and make it harder to lose the weight. Or will they help?

I’m also pretty sore in my muscles most of the time... which I don’t mind, but it baffles me bc I should be adapted to the workouts by now. Maybe I need to incorporate supplements?

209,will balancing postures in bikram yoga help me even out my hips?,"I've gone to bikram yoga class 4 times so far and I always take a day of rest after, so today is my rest day and I'll go again tomorrow.

Is all bikram yoga the same? Because the one I go to, all they ever do is the same sequence over and over again. We start with this weird breathing exercise to ""warm up from the inside"" even though its a billion degrees in there, then we do a bunch of balancing postures, some squat/lunge like postures and then back postures, then some floor things. The thing I struggle with the most is the balancing ones.

My hips are uneven, I have lateral pelvic tilt and also a right rotated hip, and I was hoping this would help correct it. That's the whole reason I started doing it. I mean, I was hoping it would because I thought for sure it was caused by muscle imbalances and even my physiotherapist said so.
I chose bikram because I enjoy the heat and think all other yoga is boring so I thought the heat would give me incentive to go, and it does.
The bikram yoga teacher told me that my balancing difficulties are most likely due to my uneven hips and that he thought it would help, but it's not getting any better, and in fact, yesterday I was feeling weaker than the first 3 classes I did!!!!!!!

I'm feeling discouraged. Do you think I should keep going, like will this help my hips, or just make things worse?

I really suck at the balancing postures (most likely because of my uneven hip issue), and it's definitely not just lack of balance, although I do struggle with a definite lack of balance... but the stabilizing muscles in my hips and legs tire so fast, incredibly fast, and it's a lot worse on one side than the other, so I'm guessing that IS a muscle imbalance. I'm just feeling really discouraged because I'm not new to working out, I've been bodybuilding and playing sports for years, so I don't know why I've developed this muscle imbalance and why I'm struggling so much with the balancing postures. The muscles that are responsible for keeping me upright on one foot are so weak, I just don't know how that even happened and I'm hoping this will help get me in better shape but I'm worried I'm doing it for nothing and that it won't help.

211,The Big Secret,"The big secret of yoga is that you will make the most progress outside of class. Yoga classes are really for demonstrating flexibility (especially your average Vinyasa class). If you actually want to become flexible you need to do fascia massages and hold poses for longer periods of time depending on what your body needs. It is worth learning the Ashtanga sequence so you have a yoga sequence you can run through at any time, holding poses for longer as you body requires.

Don't get me wrong - you will def get stronger and more flexible doing classes but it is only practicing yoga mindfully on your own where the real power lies. ",yoga
212,"Is Iyengar yoga crazy, or was my Iyengar teacher crazy?","I've been practicing yoga for more than 10 years now.  I am frankly not ""good"" at yoga for being in it so long, but yoga has changed my body and mind for the better and I truly love it.  In short, I am pretty good at embracing the spirit of the practice, if not at actually doing all the bendy stuff.  

In all my time in yoga I have had the fortune to see many styles of teaching and many styles of yoga.  Today however, was by far my worst yoga experience.  I went to an Iyengar class with a teacher who was a former director a well known Iyengar school.  From the beginning the class was pretty mean and disjointed.  The teacher made snide comments because I put my mat against a wall, but then told us all to move up against the wall.  The teacher had weird comments about the fact we grabbed some foam blocks but didn't tell us at the beginning to grab the wood blocks he apparently preferred.  It went on like this.  The dude just always had a condescending way to say everything.  I was expecting lots of talking through basic poses, but I wasn't expecting it to be so unhinged, disorganized, and disrespectful.  Nothing in the class was particularly difficult (or useful to be honest).  It was just the attitude.

Ultimately my wife, who has developed a very strong practice over many years, just up and left class, something I have never seen her do before.  I've seen a lot of teachers that are authoritative, but never really mean.  And I have seen a lot of teachers who are inexperienced, but never felt they were incompetent.  This guy was mean and incompetent and I found the experience baffling.  I read more about Iyengar and it sounds like it can tend towards being a bit regimented.  Is this what all these classes are like?  The whole mindset seemed to be contrary to all of the humility, equanimity, and kindness that I have learned are the core of yoga.",yoga

I was thinking about signing up for the teacher training in Montreal, but then I discovered a text (link below) where Swami Sivananda talks about homosexuality. I'm just trying to reconcile internally if I want to support a lineage that denounces homosexuality. At the same time, I'm trying to remind myself that people are a product of their time in history and their environment. I'm also trying to remind myself that there are Christians who don't take everything from the bible. I guess I'm struggling with my values. I also know that going to an ashram for a month could be really good for me, but I don't wanna put myself in a potentially homophobic situation. I was wondering if anyone might have any advice. What would you do? I was also wondering if anyone who has done Sivananda training can speak to this? Was it talked about in the training (I hope not :( lol).

- what are the documented effects of skipping savasana in practice? What kind of reduction in improvement of mobility or flexibility is expected to be realized if any?  I am sure there must be some research on this last point... I haven’t come across it yet.

250,What are the basic positions someone should learn when first practicing yoga?,"I will say. I have been a lurker for a while (few years) and browsed the FAQs extensively, but noticed this question is not answered directly within the FAQ, instead there are many nuanced approaches and answers to this all supported by their own logic which I can get behind. Then you have the section about reasons including 20 something year old males, depression, weight loss, etc.

But with that wealth of information, I noticed there is not a generalized one size fits all approach, and for obvious reasons. But I was wondering, what collection of poses would you recommend to a beginner and what resources would you direct them to? Of the 30 day challenge video series, many of them are not new-user friendly of course, most seem intermediate. And a lot of the FAQ's jargon seems predicated on the idea that the beginner already has some above average familiarity with yoga.

I am familiar with Antranik of course given my dedication to bodyweight fitness and as a result figured I would just default to his videos, but I noticed although I was technically able to follow along and keep up, it was not beginner friendly.

My roommate is slightly interested in yoga but years ago apparently he was into it, and he mentioned I should start with the 8 Somerset poses, but I looked into that and it seems that claim of his wasn't necessarily backed by any sort of science and given the questionable validity of the claim as well as his mediocre credentials, I didn't know how much value to place on that recommendation after researching into it, my research seemed underwhelming comparatively speaking to what he implied.

I was just wondering, if you do not know for certain of course that is fine, but in your opinion and experience, as I am currently soliciting as much as possible, what do you think the best approach for a beginner would be? I am specifically curious as to what collection of poses you would recommend to the average person.

Keep in mind I am heavily familiar with the FAQ, so I am not looking for that information, but either new information or your perspective on existing information within the FAQ.

Now keep in mind I am specifically not including information about myself because I do not want an answer tailored to me, I just want to know your specific opinion about what you would recommend to a beginner. That said, once that inquiry is satisfied, feel free to give personalized advice and support it with anecdotes if you want.

I live in New York City, so audiobooks are ideal while on the train and walking to work. Given the fast pace environment here (i.e., why I found yoga in the first place) id like to find something with good energy, not just a list of facts.

Good morning everyone. So, I am currently deployed and volunteered to continue hosting a yoga class here on base. It is currently once a week but I hope to expand to multiple classes per week. The problem is that I have no experience teaching yoga! The person hosting this class before me had a single yoga DVD they played every class and I want to improve the variety and quality. I have downloaded a few videos off of YouTube from ""Yoga with Adrienne"" and they work pretty well, but I wanted to ask all of you if there are any more YouTube channels or specific videos out there you can reccomend. I am looking for gentle yoga focusing on flexibility and approximately an hour long. We do separate PT here so I am not looking for a workout, just gentle stretching, mobility, and recovery work. Most people here are beginners and not very flexible at all. We have yoga mats here but no straps or blocks. For most people this will be their first impression of yoga and I want it to be a good one. Any help will be much appreciated! Thank you all.",yoga

In general, I try to avoid using words like ""hate"" and work towards finding strength through grit. In other words, doing things I ""hate' and getting better at them is really a thing for me. But there's one thing...

one thing that I find ridiculous and I cannot find an excuse for teachers doing that:

Before the class, some teachers say ""Say hi to someone you don't know"" or ""Introduce yourself to a person next to you"".

I absolutely cannot stand that. In years of living in SF I have encountered that many times, and if I remember the teacher's name I will not attend their class again. This forced smiling and ""Haaaai my name is Blah..."" drive me nuts. I asked my yogi friends many times - nobody likes it! I never remember the names or faces as we do not have any meaningful interactions during the class. Of course, I could sit through it with a straight face but that is also an effort in an unpleasant situation. I find these moments so unpleasant! And it's a kick off for the yoga class.

What I would like to know is if there are any schools more similar to the Bihar school as opposed to the certification schools, ie the schools that offer courses in the various aspects of yoga from Hatha to Raja, etc, teach from original spiritual texts, and maybe have some kind of an ashram lifestyle experience over the course of a couple of weeks or months. 

Also, and maybe this question is better posed to the travel subreddit, are ashrams where one can just show up and take courses common when traveling in SE Asia/India or is it usually required to sign up in advance for most of these places?

318,Could yoga be causing my severe anxiety to return?,"Hello everyone! I’ve been doing yoga for about a month now. (More specifically I finished Yoga with Adriene Revolution day 24 two days ago) I haven’t followed Adriene but have continued a few of my own stretches over the past couple of days. So the point of this is that I’m someone who has a past history with very severe anxiety. I was bed bound and completely agoraphobic for 2 years and then for another couple of years after that I somewhat functioned but was still a complete mess. With a lot of patience I got better, so better that for the past 2 years I’ve been doing fantastic. I’ve been working toward my dreams and absolutely love life, anxiety was 100% a thing of the past to the point where it was hard to believe I was ever so bad. That is, until 5 days ago. I felt a little off on Friday, mentally foggy and a little down. I didn’t think much of it and continued my regular routine which included yoga. Well I’ve progressively gotten mentally worse with each day since and it’s honestly to a point where it is scarily similar to what I experienced in the past, I’ve already been having a hard time functioning again.

I’ve just been trying to think about what could have caused this and I’ve heard a lot about yoga releasing emotions and that is the only thing I’ve really changed recently. Could the yoga potentially be bringing my history with crippling anxiety back to the surface? The thing is, it has done wonders for me physically already. My lower back pain is basically gone and I am definitely stronger and slightly more flexible. I actually crave doing it now and will be sad to stop but I also have to put my mental health first. So I’m just wondering if the “emotional release” that I hear about could be something like this? ",yoga

My very first mat was a Giam mat (maybe 3-4mm thick) I got for cheap on clearance. However, although incredibly cute, that mat proved too thin, as I have sensitive, bony knees and feet, and although I was flexible enough to do poses such as Monkey and Hero, I found the bone pain too unbearable to go deep in such postures. In January I bought a thick exercise mat for $12 at my local Marshall's, which proved wonderful for deep restorative yoga... for a while. 
However, this mat is already starting to show wear and tear and it's starting to slide as well. I'm thinking about giving the mat to my boyfriend who wants to learn and investing in a mat I won't have to worry about replacing in a couple years. 
So my question to you is which mat is better, Jade Yoga or Manduka? I do yoga 3-5 times a week in a studio and 2-4 times a week at home, so I'd be using the mat just about every day. My two main concerns are the amount of time it'll last and how thick and cushiony the mat is. So which do you think would fit my yoga style better, Jade or Manduka? Thank you in advance.

For those who fit this description. For those who have had genuine progress and inner transformation and would want to express, share, and discuss their experiences, i have created a subreddit for that very purpose: [r/trulylost](https://www.reddit.com/r/trulylost)

On that subreddit, anyone is free to come in and share what they've experienced, with no badgering of whether or not it sounds logical or by the book. It is a safe-haven for free discussion. Do you feel that you're an arhat? a buddha? a bodhisattva? a jivanmukti? have you achieved krishna-consciousness, god-consciousness, a non-dual mind, a life thats one with the Dao? then come tell us your stories! Share what youve learned and how you got to that point! Not only is it fun sharing but it also benefits those who are on their path to not only learn from your experiences, but to know that there are people out there that have actually reached those heights. That its not impossible or only for mythology, that it can be achieved by any person willing to caste away their self-doubts!

So! if this interests you, then please visit us, and if this just sounds like a crazy man talking gibberish, then please refer your complaints to my [Secretary.](https://i.imgur.com/lKOlFsL.jpg)",yoga

This big yoga reddit mostly focuses on yoga classes and asanas.  Any suggestions?  If I started one, would people be interested in discussing the philosophy of yoga?

Pressing into the floor stresses my forearms in a way that doesn't feel right.  I doubt I'm the only one to encounter this.

350,Trying to get my fire department to incorporate yoga into our workouts...any tips on getting past the machismo?,"Hi r/yoga! I've lurked here for a while and have been practicing for a few years at a beginner level.

I'm an EMT/fire fighter at a small, volunteer department. We recently started doing department workouts together to keep in shape and be ready if something happens.

 As we've been doing more training, I've noticed how many of the guys struggle from problems stemming from lack of flexibility, bodily awareness, and breathing mindfulness. I've long been a proponent of yoga and think it's exactly what we need to fully round out our training, but many of the guys seem to be put off by the idea. I've heard a whole variety of reasons- the classic ""I'm not flexible"" (which I have made very clear isn't an issue, it will improve with time and there's much more to it than being able to touch your toes) to things like ""That seems pretty hippie I don't think it's for me"". 

In reality, knowing these guys extremely well, I think most of the excuses are really stemming from the machismo that the fire service holds so dear, as well as a lack of understanding about what yoga is really about. Yoga is a ""woman's exercise"" and they don't want to participate. Does anybody have any tips on how I may change that mindset, or some good ideas for a flow that I could introduce to the more willing guys that may coax the others along/show them why I think it would be so helpful?",yoga

So in total I will be doing about 50 classes over about 9 weeks.

364,Tips for pincha/forearm balance away from the wall,"Hello! This is my first time posting. I have searched for pincha/forearm posts through here but haven't quite found the right advice for my situation.

I have been working very hard recently to do pincha/forearm stand. My dolpin pose still isn't shortened enough for me to lift one leg and press up into pincha so I kick up into it. I can kick up at the wall easily &amp; hold for over 5 breaths with (semi) straight legs. I don't really even need to touch the wall anymore, it's just helpful for me to have as a reference point so I don't overshoot.

However, whenever I try to kick into the pose without a wall nearby, I either overshoot and have to twist and bail OR I undershoot &amp; just come back down. Does anyone have any tips to get me off the wall? I think my strength is there, I just haven't found my balance point. I drill the pose frequently every day &amp; do the proper strengthening exercises as well. I'd really like to nail this before summer's end!

I also seem to kick and bring my legs up together, so maybe if I kicked into split legs, that would help me balance more easily. But I'm not sure how to kick like that.

Thanks for the help!

I’m still pretty new to yoga. Typically, I have been practicing in the evenings. Recently, I’ve decided to challenge myself by getting up early and doing my practice before I go to work in the mornings. I figured it would be a good way to start my day/warm up.

Coordinating the breathing is the hard part for me, i feel like my breading most of the times is not coordinated with video. And also I always have to look to the video and distract myself to see the pose because I still dont know all the names to the poses.
I also tried doing a ""routine"" just from I feel like doing, wich i loved it. But i dont feel like I'm doing it 100% right because of the breathing.

372,"Serial farter in class, how to deal?","Look, i find farts hilarious and are nothing to be ashamed about. Im also aware that yoga can bring it out in people sometimes. 

However, i take a twice weekly restorative class and this older woman who frequents the class ALWAYS lets loose. I mean, like 6-8 times an hour. The teacher knows this, and has mentioned indirectly in class to not eat before taking a class etc... the worst part is this woman when she farts, she has an audible reaction to her own farting, which makes it 100x more hilarious. She kinda lets out a ""uuuhhhuh"" noise after she farts, kinda a mix between relief and embarrassment. 

Im having a real hard time not laughing out loud, i know its immature but goddamn. Last night she did it again and the teacher went into talking about how we should visualize a balloon in our bellys and that when we breathe out we should expel all the air from the balloon. I had to cover my mouth to hold back my laughter, im pretty sure the teacher said what she said because of the farting and that we both find it funny.

While its all funny, its kind of ruining the class for me. I take the class to get into my body and this totally prevents that. The farting woman is also somewhat rude. She takes up a lot of space and doesnt think about her neighbors, she steals props, pushes her props into other peoples areas, stretches well outside of her mat area, etc..she smacked me in the chest once when strerching then glared at me as if i were in her way. I feel like she is sucking the energy out of the class for her own righteousness. She has mentioned a few times how she gets dinner right before class and has a glass of wine. Maybe she is trolling everyone? I want to mention it to my teacher but am not quite sure how to approach it. its a small community and i can see how this might be a delicate subject.",yoga

374,New to the sub? New to yoga? Start here.,"Version 2018! Copypasta continues. 

If you are new to the sub or new to yoga, WELCOME! There is an immense amount of information available in this sub, and an excellent community of people. 

If you have a question, PLEASE check out the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) and try search before creating a new post. As noted in rule 2, commonly asked questions are removed and directed to the above. 

**The updated version of the 'usual' sticky thread:**

This post is intended as a repository of pertinent info, including updates for new and ongoing issues. For the sake of visibility, we'll try to include links as pertinent.

**Reminders:**

* It's in the sidebar, it's in the rules, it's in the note when you create a new post. *PLEASE utilize search and the FAQ before creating a new post.* Especially around the first of the year, it's not unusual to see 3 versions of the same post in a day, asking questions that are well covered in the sub. If your post is removed because the answers are available there the mod team is not scolding you, we're just letting you know why it was done and reminding you that the answers you seek already exist. And yes, the mod team finds themselves busy doing just that this time of year. 

* /r/yoga is not the place for medical advice. This is always a handy reminder.
* **Addendum to the above** - Yoga philosophy and western medicine are different. There is room for both in this sub. This means that things like subtle bodies and energy (prana) movement and chakras *all have a place here* as well as discussion from a western perspective. There is no demand that anyone agrees with what is presented, but rule 1 applies in these cases- be respectful. 

* Yes, we have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/index) and [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) . (And they're awesome.)
The FAQ and search are the best places to start if you're new to yoga or have questions about styles, equipment, injuries, or resources. Plans in the works include a section for teachers, expansion of the section regarding yoga and other activities, and potentially an additional section for the questions that are common that to add to the FAQ would continue to grow an already large document. More FAQ updates will be coming, but in the meantime, we have continued to leave up questions that haven't been in awhile to keep more up-to-date information available when it exists.

* Yes, they're even available via app and mobile. Yes, really. (The sidebar, too!) It can take a little looking, but we haven't yet found an app without access to the sidebar.

* Reddit's guidelines are still the foundation of how we approach spam in /r/yoga, and bans will continue to be a thing as needed. Need the details? Reddit's guidelines are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

* This sub is not for market research. It's a community. Requests for the sub to tell you what we love or hate about our yoga mats and t-shirts will be removed, as will asking us to fill out surveys for that or your thesis research. Those are not the only such examples. When in doubt, feel free to message the mods ahead of time. Established community members can message mods ahead of time for permission on a case-by-case basis. 


**Other notes:**

* The automoderator is in use and working relatively well in terms of catching spam, and the mod team continues to monitor what is being automatically removed. Sometimes we catch them in the first 5 minutes, but sometimes it's a few hours between mod sweeps. If you've posted something that isn't showing up, you're welcome to message the mods (keeping in mind that it's possible it will be a bit before a mod sees it- please be patient!) and ask about it- including a link is much appreciated.

* Your mod team is human (you totally thought we were unicorns and rainbow-chasing leprechauns, but aside from cosplay and Halloween, not so much). Part of modding is making judgement calls, and sometimes we remove things that we can't be sure there isn't a bot behind that turns out to be totally legit because another real, in-the-flesh reddit user actually did post. :) Much like the point above, feel free to ask.

* The discussions on the Sutras have been collected on a wiki page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/sutras). Feel free to continue contributing to those threads as well as the current one. 

* As with the last update, COMP remains as-is. The mod team is done rehashing this topic, which will likely result in the posts questioning COMP that inevitably happen every time someone new finds them questionable being removed and referred to [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/search?q=COMP+self%3Ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;count=25&amp;after=t3_39saiq), until/unless the overall focus in the sub shifts substantially. For those unaware and interested, /u/BeyondMars posted [the following](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/48aaq2/should_an_individual_moderator_make_decisions/d0i424h) last time it came up to get everyone up to speed- here's the section on rule 4, to which I added the link:

&gt;&gt;&gt;   Search the history of this sub for discussions on [COMP] poses. [Probably two years ago now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1i9x4s/mod_post_state_of_the_subreddit_reminders_selfies/) There is a VERY LARGE part of this sub that doesnt wan't them to have a place here at all. The gist of it is that people come to reddit and dont want it to be like another yoga instagram, or something, I dont know. But there were portions of time in this sub when our ENTIRE front page was yoga pics. COMP was an effort to a compromise that would allow people to filter them out if they didnt want them there... In regards to the self-doxxing aspect. Sexual harassment, and online bullying have originated in this sub at least four times that I was made aware of. This rule was instituted to keep everyone safe. I don't care if YOU want your instagram accounts on the sub (self promotion?) but we are keeping people safer with this rule and the way we enforce it. Its going to stay. Take the extra 2 minutes and upload it to imgur.

28 June addition: 

It seemed obvious to the mod team when it was discussed a week or so ago, but for the sake of clarity, it's being noted here as well and will continue to be enforced, *especially* on COMP posts:

**Sexual/sexualized/objectifying comments are not welcome here. Removals are guaranteed, and warning vs. ban will be handled on a case-by-case basis.** 

Just don't. It all falls under rule 1.

I am in no rush to get there and do not expect to become wealthy teaching, but it is something I would slowly and mindfully like to work towards. I have simply never found anything that gave me so much joy as practicing and sharing my practice with others. How can I deepen my practice in preparation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

386,HASH/WEED for Sadhaka - Let's put an end to this.,"Hey, I'm really trying to figure out what hash/weed's purpose is in Sadhaka. I've been getting so many different views on it, and still haven't been able to figure it out completely myself. I know that most Western Yoga Teachers are complete imbeciles when it comes to this question, because they will feed back the answer of a puritanical response, even though it is quite baseless.

Many tantras yes... they have agreed that cannabis is a proper addition to ones Sadhaka. So my question is this: Is hash really that deductive of ones Sadhaka, or is it CONDUCTIVE? Trying to figure this out... because I certainly do not trust Western Yoga Teachers when it comes to spirituality and philosophy regarding this. (they are best teaching kriyas.)

​

Some than have said that it generates too much 'wind' in the mind. Too much of that magickal element. I could see this, but than again, if people wanna get elemental - than you would just ground the energy and do a bout of yoga to level this out. Looking for a experiential view...

​

391,Found my way back to yoga last night,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share some thoughts I had last night.  

I started practicing yoga in March of this year by following YWA's videos on YouTube. I started with her Revolution series and then went into True. Loved both of those! My shoulder hurt a little bit one day, so I decided to ease up on practicing every day. Well, I quickly fell out of practicing at all. The shoulder pain went away after a day or two but I just couldn't get back into it. At the same time, I was also going through a rough patch in my life. I knew yoga would help because I had been feeling so good while doing it but I was just feeling discouraged about a lot of things in life. Even though the shoulder pain went away I felt like what's the point of getting back into it if I'm just going to have to stop again if my shoulder starts hurting?  

I got into yoga in the first place because of lower back pain from sitting at a desk all day and this pain has returned since I stopped practicing yoga. So two nights ago I decided to start being more consistent (I had started Yoga Camp but hadn't gotten far). Last night I did Day 8 and it was exactly what I needed. The whole sequence was on the floor and a lot on the back (plus she said to grab a pillow, I love when yoga involves a pillow!) I loved it so much I found another random yoga for back video and followed that one too for a full hour of relaxing, peaceful, back healing yoga. It was the first time in a while I didn't care how long the video would be or how much time I'd have left before I had to go to sleep. I was just focused on helping my back to feel better.  

I think I'm going to focus on mostly restorative and gentle yoga for now, since that's what my body seems to like most. I'm only in my late 20s so it's kind of depressing to me to think I can't do the level of physical activity I want to do, but I know that's only temporary. I need to be kind to myself, take it easy, and listen to what my body is telling me. If my shoulder starts hurting again I'm going to go get it checked out. I hate setting up appointments with doctors or for anything really but I know it's important to take care of myself. I imagine a world where I'm not in pain and have the energy to do what I really want to do in life. I can get there but I need to give myself a helping hand.",yoga
392,Postnatal yoga advice?,"Hello! I’m cleared from my doctor and would like to slowly get back into my yoga routine. I’ve been doing simple salutations most days but need a longer flow sequence now. I would like to use online resources since leaving the house with my little guy is nearly impossible right now.

What is the best way to ease back in? I started slacking off around third trimester and am 2 months post partum now, so it’s been almost 5 months since I’ve really been practicing.

I’ve done yoga with Adriene and fightmaster yoga in the past. I feel like fightmaster is too fast and hard right now but ywa doesn’t quite do it for me. I dislike her chatter and really just need someone to help lead a guided flow.

I’ve tried some free flow but I think since I’m so out of practice right now I need a little guidance, plus I always resort to the same few poses and like the suggestions of things I don’t think to go to.

I guess I’m looking for suggestions for online classes/instructors and also any advice to get back into practice. I find it hard to get a long flow in (I’m usually interrupted within 20 minutes) so that has been frustrating. I keep telling myself any yoga is good. 

I’m really struggling with my body post partum. I feel so weak and everything is so tight. I would like to gain some strength and flexibility back so I can begin to feel more like myself again.",yoga
393,Teachers- how do you usually plan a class? Or do you even plan your classes?,"I usually practice on my own and then write out the sequence that came up, unless a student makes a request. Depending on who comes I usually switch up the pace or sequence. I sped about an hour sometimes less when I plan and write out a class sequence. In teacher training we were taught to always have a peak pose and theme which I sometimes do but usually the theme arises when I’m in the moment, about to teach. Sometimes there isn’t even a distinct theme, and I think that’s okay. My students are happy and i have definitely found my groove when it comes to planning out and teaching a fun class, however I would love to hear about what other teachers do :-)",yoga
394,Extremely Tight Hip Flexors Causing Knee Pain,"Hi everyone!  
For some background- I'm a 27 year old yogi who's been practicing around 6 days a week for the past 3 years. Generally, I've always been very flexible and have had extremely open hips and loose hip flexors if anything. For example, lowering  hips down all the way in pigeon was a breeze, able to do splits, could sink deep in low lunge and it felt good.

A couple weeks ago I took 3 classes lead by a well known but tough yogi. I definitely pushed myself with a lot of strengthening core/hip flexor stuff but didn't feel any pain at the time. I did notice in the cool down of one class I could barely get into pigeon let alone sink all the way down because the contracted leg's hip flexor was SO tight.   


For a week after this I would try to practice regularly and I noticed both hip flexors were super tight and I was starting to feel pain in the outer edge of one of my knees at the same time. I've had sensitive knees in the past in certain poses but knew to back off and it would go away within a day or two... But this pain in one of my knees and tightness in both of my hip flexors could be felt when I was walking even not doing yoga.  


So I took a week break from yoga thinking that would help and I stopped noticed it while I was walking.. But coming back to yoga, now it's same thing. I'm trying to focus on stretching them out.. But still most open hip poses such as frog, seated wide leg forward fold, malasana, childs pose, happy baby I feel impossible tightness my hip flexors and some I feel the knee pain (I thought stretching it out would help?). Any closed hip flexor lengthening poses like low lunge and high lunge I feel the same.. This is even worse cause it's started to effect my low back as I'm arching it to compensate. Pigeon is a problem in the flexors of both legs as well.  


I have no idea really what happened or what I should do now. Is there something I should be stretching or strengthening that I'm not doing?   


If anyone has any experience with this or advice it would be so nice. I'm feeling a bit frustrated as a daily practitioner not being able to do stuff that used to feel good and easy in my body. Although I will say as a positive, it's going to help me grow as a teacher. :)  


Thanks for any help and sorry for the length!

1. Is going just once a week enough to see progress? I know I should try to go more, but i don’t really have much time unfortunately. I might find some online videos and try to do it another time a week on my own. 

2. Downward dog sucks. I have so much trouble. I’m just not flexible enough to do it right, so I’ve been doing some research on different modifications. Is the best way to just bend the legs and lift heals off the ground and make sure to keep the spine and arms aligned? 

3. Another thing regarding that, they do this thing where they lift the heals and go from toes then heal back on ground when in downward dog. Even with my knees bent I can’t really get my heel to the ground, should I just kind of pretty pressure back into my heel as much as I can, then back into toes?

4. Another thing was we did fallen triangle (I think that’s what she called it), and my arm was shaking a lot along with a few other poses. Is this a balance or a strength thing, so I know which I need to work on focus on to make it smoother and more comfortable. How long do you think it’ll take to be more... solid in this positions. 

5. Breathing. I always feel like I’m breathing wrong or out of synch with the movements she’s doing / the class. Is it okay if I do some transitions a little slower or faster?

This woman in the back row got up and started spiking blocks left and right going on about poor yoga etiquette.

406,Trying to get into yoga but I can't even do beginner stuff,"Hello. I'm a 23 years old male ( 188cm/86kg ^^6'2""/190lb ), and I haven't done exercise for most of my life. I have mild scoliosis and I've suffered from back pain for a long time already. Lately I've been trying to make an effort to improve my health. I've tried to minimize my sitting time and improve my posture, been running regularly for a month, and yesterday I started Yoga with Adriene's 30 Days of Yoga series.

I could barely do most of the stuff for the first day, but I sticked to the end. I figured even if I half-assed most of the posses, I was still doing something and I'd eventually be able to do them properly, but today I had to stop half-way the 2nd day video because I couldn't do anything at all and I was feeling like I was about to collapse. i.e I can't plant my feet when doing Downward Facing Dog, and when doing the Half Forward Bend I can't get my hands to the floor without bending my knees and I worry that I'm rounding my back too much.

[Then, I decided to do a quick reddit search, and it seems like the consensus between xxfitness is that her routines are too easy](https://np.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/5ee7j0/does_anyone_do_the_yoga_with_adriene_videos/). Needless to say, I'm feeling really unmotivated.

My main objective is to fix my posture, gain more flexibility and learn how to not round my back and do simple things like squat properly. My end goal is to have a good foundation for doing compound lifts, as I've always been interested in powerlifting, but I'm not able to do the most basic stuff with weights so I figured I should improve my body awareness and flexibility without weights first.

I'm thinking that I might just have a mental block rather than physically not being able to do those poses correctly, but I've been sitting most of my life so I think I'm just way too stiff.

I have been into meditation for a few years and have always known about Yoga and heard how good it was for you both mentally and physically.

2 weeks ago I went and signed up for a monthly membership at a local studio and since then have gone pretty much every day (11 times exactly) and have loved every part of it.

My point for making this post is that if you have been thinking about trying a yoga class but still haven't made it in...just go.  I'm a guy and was anxious about going the first time but once there I felt at home because everyone was so nice and welcoming.

I know classes may not be for everyone or maybe not in the budget right now but if you have been wondering and can fit it in the budget I think you'll really enjoy it if you just give it a try.

Alternatively if you like to keep your practice at home, keep doing you...no judgement here.

Also, there are so many freaking styles of yoga that I had no idea about, and its been so fun to explore them all (my favorite is iyengar because...inversions). And the best part are the instructors. They're so hands on and go around fixing people's forms and advising them on what they can improve on.

417,New to yoga &amp; wary of effects on spine/lower back (no pre-existing injuries),"Hi yogis.  I'd like someone to explain the rationale for certain yoga poses/movements for me, and I hope my wariness won't be taken the wrong way.  My partner, who is doing a PhD in spinal health (and has a degree in exercise physiology, and has been a gym instructor for over 10 years), has made me hypervigilant about protecting my back during any kind of exercise.  Basically he tells me that too much spinal extension is terrible, and that you should never twist laterally when in spinal flexion.  I've noticed several poses or transitions involve a fair degree of exactly this - spinal extension (e.g. cobra, upward facing dog, back bends - obviously) or twisting while in flexion.  Last night I did a class where we were encouraged to lie supine over a (quite large) bolster to 'protect the spine', which put us into pretty significant extension.  My partner was horrified when I demonstrated all this for him!!  So my question is:

\- have I gotten this completely wrong and we *shouldn't* be doing these kinds of movements in yoga?

\- is my partner just overly conservative and risk-averse (highly likely)?

\- if these things are really a part of yoga, how are such 'dangerous' movements justified, and how do you avoid injuries while performing them?

This has been my lifestyle choice for years, so it is no stretch for me to assure you that I won't blame you if your help or advice does not work or even if it makes me worse.  And my questions are very general.                 

I had a slightly collapsed disk with herniation and inflammation about 6 years ago or so.  It hurt like hell.  I had to scoot around the grocery store in those scooters for old and crippled people.  I was about 66 years old at that time.  I said at the time that I was going to heal myself.  I did.  I healed the inflamed part and the herniation part with many practices all piled together, including eating an anti-inflammatory diet.                

But now the collapsed disk is beginning to hurt and be inflamed.  It is nothing like what I went through 6 years ago.  That pain basically saved my life by forcing me to get hardcore about diet and exercise and health in general.                  

Now I am looking to yoga (and other things) to help with the collapsed disk.  I am fully aware that this time, being almost 73, I may not be able to heal it.  But I am going to try because it is my responsibility to try, for the sake of my family and for my sake.  This is my plan:

439,Advice needed for improving staff pose,"Hi all,

I have recently started taking yoga classes, because I have lately suffered some injuries and want to get rid of my hypertonic pelvic floor. I noticed at the first lessons that I am very stiff in many areas and I notice this mainly at the staff pose.

​

[Staff pose](https://i.redd.it/mer5kpwcifi11.jpg)

I tried sitting on a bolster, with a folded towel and yoga block on it, but still my lower back is getting rounded. My sitting bones are pulled towards my knees. Is it good to start practicing this pose on the elevated bolster+towel+block level or is that still not the way to go because of the rounded lower back?

Is it possible that my extremely strong hypertonic pelvic floor influences this pose? Maybe that the pelvic floor muscle is also pulling at my sitting bones? How can I improve this pose or are there other poses which can help with this problem?

I also think i have some anterior pelvic tilt, which you can see on the most right picture. Can someone confirm this? Does this also affect the pose?

​

I hope someone can give me some instructions/advice for working towards an injury-free life :).

​

Thanks in advance, Mike",yoga

443,"Things Change, Practice Stays","Back in March, I was teaching hot yoga seven days a week and practicing for an hour every day. Even though asana is only one small component of yoga, I was appreciative of my physical practice and proud of what I had been able to accomplish over almost nine years.

And then in April, I woke up one morning with back pain so bad I couldn’t move. Out of nowhere I suddenly couldn’t even walk. I would drag myself onto the floor to do cat-cow and ustrasana, but my knees were so swollen I couldn’t do child’s pose and my back hurt so badly that laying in savasana was excruciating. 

I spent two months battling randomly swelling joints, periods of complete immobility, and the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life. Finally at the beginning of June I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own joints, synovial fluid, and systems. I’ve since begun treatment and am starting to get some mobility and strength back, but I’ve lost nearly 60 lbs and am weaker than I have ever been. I also have nowhere near the range of motion I had back in March, and have pain or limited mobility in most parts of my body.

My practice has completely changed. RA saps energy, and one of its primary symptoms is extreme fatigue. I used to be in the hot room for hours at time. Now I do a few poses at home and take a break. I practice about 15-30 minutes at a time a few times a day. I take a weekly chair yoga class and gentle yoga twice a week with brilliant teachers. I focus on comfort, acceptance, and compassion for my body and mind. Practice exists to provide me with mental and physical relief from a disease that has taken a lot from me. It has been difficult not to be bitter about losing so much of what I worked for on a physical level, but I am starting to realize the beautiful things this experience has given me. When I am able to work again, I will be better equipped to meet my students where they are, and can reaffirm that this practice has so much more to offer than postures. It stayed with me through every moment of suffering and every moment of complete discouragement. I would practice pranayama to calm myself when the pain medication couldn’t touch what was happening, and I would meditate when my brain went a million miles an hour living in limbo and waiting for diagnosis. My practice was always there, maybe not in the form I wanted or was used to, but it held me up when I felt powerless.

Life changes fast. I’m living in what feels like a completely different body and mind. Everything is shaky and it feels hard sometimes to find solid ground. But when I practice, I’m home. It doesn’t matter how it looks or how strong I am. There I am present, I am whole, and I am well. Nothing can ever take my practice from me, ever. And that is the most comforting, reassuring thing I could possibly know in this moment. And despite how I did, I am so grateful to have learned that.

444,Trouble with DownDog and DD variations,"Hello everyone

I’m about 6’ 190lbs with muscular build. I recently discovered a love for yoga and have been practicing for a few months. 


I have had a lot of trouble holding myself in downdog. Even more difficulty with 3 legged dog. Doing knee to elbow touches are very difficult also. I get an overwhelming feeling of fatigue in my arms and shoulders though that is where I feel I carry the most strength. 


The instructors have all said my hands and over all form are good but I still just can’t get over how hard that pose has been for me. 


I have been dropping to my knee when I feel my body giving out, and still try to persevere with the leg motions. 


I guess I’m looking for some advise of methods of improving it this area, or affirmation that this is just part of the process. ",yoga

446,I am the only guy in a class of 25 at my college,"I have way too many aches and pains for someone my age. I also have lost a lot of mobility in my knee and ankle from having a full leg cast a few years ago. I had a roommate who was really into yoga during my study abroad so I did it with him and some other guys and really enjoyed it. Also last year, I took a general fitness class at my college. One day for that class, we joined the yoga class for one of their sessions. There were at least 5 guys in there and even a football player. So when I signed up for yoga this year, I never expected to be the only guy. 

On our first class, I walked in and instantly felt that I should drop the class. I was the only guy in the room and felt so out of place. We didn’t actually do anything our first day other than talk about the class expectations. We did introductions and were asked to say what inspired us to take yoga. I made sure to be honest for my inspiration and say that I’m trying to rehab from some past injuries. I’m still concerned that I won’t be able to stay focused this semester during the class because I’m too worried about what other people think of me. I don’t want to come across as being there just to stare or to meet girls. Should I just drop the class since I’m so concerned?

It's one of those 9.5 mm Sterling  dynamic lead/gym ropes that's made to take a beating. We got it five  years ago. We've used it on average 2x/week since then. In all that  time, we've probably only taken a handful of falls on it each.   


The  rope seems fine and shows no signs of wear outside of what would be  expected. There's nothing that shouts it should be immediately replaced  (core shot, fraying, etc). It does seem much more supple then when we  first got it, but that's to be expected.  I've been told to replace your ropes every five years regardless of the amount of falls you've taken on it.  What do you all think.... Is it time to replace it or should we wait another year or so? ",climbing

557,Mental game after a fall,"Hi all, first-time Reddit poster here, not looking for medical advice but just your general tips. 

I've been bouldering for about a year now (went from v0 up to most recently v3). I'm female and pretty small, so I mainly just climb for fun and to meet interesting folks. 

I took a pretty bad fall in the gym a few weeks ago. The wall was slightly overhung, and for some reason when I fell I wasn't upright and couldn't get my feet under me in time. I hit the mat pretty hard from right near the top of the wall - maybe 10 feet I'd estimate. Just kind of crashed down onto my arm/side with a fair amount of whiplash. I had a headache after and was sore for a few days. 

Now I'm finding myself too scared to climb even v0 jugs. I keep thinking about the fall and can't get past the ""barrier"" of trusting smaller footholds, lunging for a far-away hold, etc. I'm pretty bummed because I love climbing. This has definitely taken the joy out of it. 

How do you get back your focus and mental psych after a fall? I know falling in the gym and not outside is way less intense but for some reason it's still getting to me.

574,Help with a finger injury,"Today I was trying a 7A-7B boulder problem with a long right hand reach to a small crimp. While I was reaching for it my foot slipped and I only got 3 fingers to the crimp and my hand slipped from the hold so that it hurt my right ring finger.

It didn't hurt too much at the time but after that holding onto anything else (even jugs) hurt so I stopped climbing immediately. There is very little swelling and when resting it doesn't hurt at all. I can move and use it without.

After 2 days it doesn't hurt at all even when hanging from a pull up bar. Gently crimping also doesn't hurt but when applying more pressure it starts to hurt a bit.

I had a similar injury (which happened in an almost identical situation) in my left ring finger. I visited a doctor back then and she said it would be OK to continue climbing but advised to take it easy. It continued to hurt a bit while crimping and in slopers but the pain disappeared completely after a 2 week break from climbing.

My question is this:

1.) Can I continue climbing as long as it does not hurt?

2.) I will be visiting a doctor soon but I doubt that he won't take further tests unless I demand it. I'm worried it could be a A2 pulley or something so should I just demand an X-ray to be sure?

Also on another note any tips to protect fingers would be nice. I'm starting to get worried since this es already the second time something like this has happened in a short while.

585,How long does it take to gain flexibility?,"So, basically I have been doing yoga for over 2 years now and still cannot sit up straight with straight legs, can barely do cobra some days, and my hips in bound-angle pose are about as far from touching the ground as is physiologically possible, just to name a few things. 

However, when I started doing yoga I didn’t really do it correctly (I believe) and not very often or long, but I have been doing whole-body stretching (not yoga) to increase flexibility, after warming up to prevent injury, for almost a year now p, as well as doing yoga on a far more regular basis for spiritual reasons, and even after stretching everyday (sometimes twice a day), and warming up properly beforehand I still cannot sit up straight in staff pose consistently (if I am full warmed up if I’m lucky I can just get my legs straight with a straight back but to get to that point it took about 9-10 months and in almost a year later it hasn’t improved by more than half and inch at best).

It’s like my muscles are scared to allow me more range of motion. I know that physiologically we all have different shaped joints and different connective tissue and ligaments, etc, but even if I am one of those people who will never be able to do a decent backbend or even the splits, surely I should be able to at least touch my toes?

Actually, the only progress I have actually seen (just slightly but still noticeable) is my shoulder mobility and overhead extension (my lats must be on my side, haha. No pun intended). 

You know, ironically, I’m able to flat-foot squat with ease (even with both feet together on good days), so I have no idea how I can do something like that when I’m about as mobile as a steel cable.
Literally, my hips and pirformis muscles are so tight I get knee pain (with flexed feet) when doing thread the needle, fire log pose (though not every day), and if I’ve been doing a lot of exercise my knees can hurt sitting in sukasana (cross-legged), but that’s only when I try to lightly stretch by leaning forward.

589,My journey with yoga (longer post),"Hello and namaste!

This is a post about how yoga helped me in my life, maybe you will find it interesting and helpful, I would also appriciate the feedback. English is not my first language, so I am sorry for any lingual mistakes.

About a year ago (age 27), I went through my worst depression period ever (not eating, not sleeping, not even moving much), I developed all sorts of anxiety disorders, I was really struggling to find myself as a person and thinking about how I have been living my life that led me to that moment. Before that time I was working as a software developer and I was finishing my computer science diploma, I had a lot on my back and was really tired and unhappy, so I spent all my free time smoking weed and playing video games, closing myself into a world that was smaller and unhappier each day. I was not hanging out with my friends anymore and did not have much interest in anything, my diet was so bad I won't even talk about that. I felt bad about myself and didn't know how to change things. I somehow managed to finish my diploma but it didn't make me feel like it was suppose to. From there things really started to go downhill, I got sick with some rare bacterial infection that crashed my immune system, which I think was mostly caused with how I was living my life. Because of this I lost my work, no one knew what exactly was wrong with my health and if am getting better anytime soon, so I got laid off. My girlfriend left me, she couldn't handle the state I was in and our relationship was non-existant. Everything led to somekind of mental breakdown, but with a lot of help of a few people I had left, I somehow managed not to do anything stupid and realized that I really need to change things about me and my life. The path had a lot of ups and downs and everything was really hard, especially at the start, but I kept getting up even when I lost all motivation, kept on going and learning. I was keeping myself busy and stayed by myself most of the time, sometimes feeling really lonely, yet I think the solitude had a big impact on everything I learned. And I must say I learned so much and it helped me to find out who I really am and what I really wanted to do in my life. I learned where I want to go and the most important thing is, I am healthy again.

So at first I realized I needed to start at the basics, diet, some kind of physical activity, calmness of mind that of course brings good sleep (I was refusing to take any antidepressants, because I think happiness should come from within the person not from a pill). Since I lost my work and I have somehow managed to finish my diploma, I had a lot of time to do an indepth research about this things. Diet was kinda of hard, since I lost all the interest for food. I started learning a lot about diet and food industry, to keep myself motivated to find meaning in eating food. I learned about how beneficial vegeterian diet can be for someone and I saw only good reasons in this, it seemed like the only logical diet for me. I started to slowly eat more because I knew my body needs the nutrients to function properly. I first came across yoga and what excatly yoga is (at that time I tought it was just some form of physical exercise), when I was researching breathing and meditation. Yoga tought me how noone should be hurt and for the first time in a long time I really felt good about myself, since I was working hard not to hurt anyone. I started doing breathing exercises and slowly developed a daily meditation practice which helped me to calm down my mind and I started to think and see things more clearly. I was also amazed with the yoga poses, especially hand balance poses. It looked really hard, but I wanted to do that one day. I started doing research on everything connected with controlling your body and bodyweight, this is where I found the similar aspects within yoga asanas and bodyweight exercises. I started doing exercises for full body strenght combined with a lot of asanas and slowly developed my exercising routines. I learned which poses I really enjoy and which poses I want to learn. After a few months of getting in better physical condition, I was already setting my goals for some advanced poses and here is where I realized how much time and effort I am putting into this and that this is something I actually really love doing, being active and staying healthy. I started running in nature and hiking mountains, which also had great impact on my mental state.

So here I am one year later and yoga now plays a great role in my life. I got my health back again, somehow my body managed to fight off the infection, no one really knows how, I am full of energy and I feel stronger as ever. I have achieved all my goals I have set for myself and even surpassed some, I now know that a lot is possible with the right mindset. I have decided on what I am going to do in my life because I want to do it and not care about what other people think, who I should be or what should I do. I am now helping an elderly lady with her everyday stuff which brings me some income to get me by and I feel really good about this. I don't do any work with computers anymore, I try to keep away from them, I don't care about how much money I can make and what I can buy with that, I will no longer stay on my previous path which I think was destructive for my life. I have met some wonderul people who I share interest with and I feel good and relaxed around them, I am thinking of doing a climbing course since I want to go to the mountains even more. In october I will start my first semester at a yoga school, first only practicing and after a while learning on yoga training. This is what I love to do, I love to be and stay healthy and I want to do my best to try and teach others about being healthy. I will do everything in my power to achieve this.

Here is a picture which shows how my outside look changed and I think it also represents the changes in my mental state. Left side is a about a year ago, when things were still really bad and the right side is now.

Thank you for reading. :)

EDIT:  I made a quick google document about my favourite asanas and how my routines look like for anyone who was wondering. It is missing the evening section of stretching poses (folds and bends), I will add that once I have more time, I will also update other sections if something changes. This is just how I like to do my routines and I also advise you to find and develop your own favourite asanas and routines so you will keep doing them consistenly. Asanas are mostly written in Sanskrit, I prefer it that way so I can learn the names.

I was walking to the bus stop yesterday after having a great slow morning involving yoga after a two week break. I felt so fucking good. Like too good to be true good. It’s like being high. The high that comes with taking care of yourself, of being in your best physical and mental health. A long-term high, created from investments rather than consuming something. There’s nothing like it. The clarity of mind you acquire, the peacefulness, the pleasure of being in your body...  

Thinking about this because last night I drank quite a bit and relapsed because I was drunk, smoking five cigarettes over the night. Today, I feel like getting intoxicated really kind of undoes that healthy natural feeling very quickly. It’s like I gotta get back into the swing of things and recover.

I did this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAJMkewEGdI&amp;list=PLLjd1nCiEK7KSRmgX0HMBh3_Uivxd8MXo&amp;index=5 today. I wanted to try someone new. She's a bit too advanced because I needed to sneak peaks the whole time because I felt the instructions weren't clear enough. 

I would love to go to a real studio but under my personal circumstances, it just isn't possible for the foreseeable future. I love yoga, I get bogged down by the sheer amount of youtube videos there are. 

Thanks for reading, and have a good day.",yoga
599,Pain in shoulders!,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been doing yoga on and off for a couple years, and I’ve never had this problem until I had been practicing more regularly recently. Anytime I go into a table or down dog, my shoulders are KILLING me, and then hurt for days after. I do have scoliosis, although it has never been a problem in any other exercising I have done. 

Are there any warmups I can do or different ways to hold these poses? I don’t want to have to give up to save my shoulders!",yoga

608,One injury leading to another?,"After having some muscle spasms in my traps due to overtraining, I went to my doctor. I also had some tightness in my chest muscles. This seemed to be causing some thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms. She said to hold back on the harder sports I was involved in but keep stretching and doing yoga. My traps are slowly getting better.

But, in trying to correct my posture, I seem to have irritated some other muscles in my upper back, shoulders and glutes. I switched to a standing desk and now I'm getting some tightness in my glutes and some sciatic nerve compression symptoms in my legs that comes and goes (calves and shins get cold and tingly). Also, my left forearm is now cramping and is also cold and tingly.

2 weeks ago, she said to come and see her in 4-6 weeks if I wasn't any better. I'm on the verge of going back next week. My symptoms are much better on the weekends when I'm not working at my desk job all day.

Gave yoga a go to stretch out my legs and core to help with recovery and prevent injury. So far I’ve seen massive improvements. I hurt less after running,  I cycle faster and I just feel a lot looser. And then there’s the added benefit of the endorphin high which is much greater from just a short amount of stretching over what I’d normally get after a long run/cycle. 

When I do camel pose I keep getting cramp in my lats. I can prevent it by not breathing so deeply. The muscle is quite relaxed (or not being stretched at least) so I’m not sure what’s going on. 

I’m guessing either my form is off, although I’ve recorded myself doing it and it looks more or less ok, or my lats need strengthening. Maybe they’re tensing up to try and keep my body stable.

Anyone got any advice on what is best to do to fix this? Should I just keep at it and hopefully be able to hold it longer without cramp? Or should I  work on back strength?

So I’ve been doing yoga on/off for more than a year, it then became what i did during active recovery days. But I went through what I would call a “training crisis”. I didn’t know why I was weight lifting, why I was running or why I was doing calisthenics. I felt like it was wrong, that it wasn’t really me. I mean, I did enjoy sport and physical activity, but I had done these things over and over for more than 3 years, and my practice did not evolve as much as I did. Eventually, I did stopped doing everything except yoga, which was the only thing I still enjoyed, and it was in line with my goals.

So I started doing Yoga nearly everyday, sometimes twice a day thanks to the downdog app, it felt great, I felt great afterward, everything was fine. But I tried to deepen my practice, I knew a bit about yoga styles, but not much, so I tried to learn more about most styles. Two styles in particular pleased me:

* **Vinyasa:** what I started with, and what I still enjoy a lot. I love the fact that the class is really flowing, each movement leading to the next one really is something I enjoy. Overall I felt great, improved quite a bit and thought I was getting a good workout overall

* **Ashtanga:** ashtanga is amazing in principles, I love the fact that it is rooted in yogic principles; that it follows a tradition, I love doing Surya Namaskar A and B plus the fundamentals postures, I love this moving meditation and I love the community. However, I really don’t like the series. I mean it doesn’t seem to be a balanced at all (but I may be missing a point). On the top of that, I feel like apart from the Surya Namaskar, ashtanga isn’t flowing that much for a Vinyasa style, and isn't way more flexibility focused than what people say.

So here is my problem: I can’t decide which style I should focus on. I really like the physical aspect of Vinyasa, and I really like the philosophy of Ashtanga, but I don’t seem to be able to ally both. What do you think I should do?

(while re reading the post it seems like some ashtangis could think I'm attacking them and their favourite yoga style, which believe me isn't my intention at all, I actually love your style and find most ashtangis really inspiring)

662,New Shoulder Issue in Down Dog,"I'm new to this sub--hoping one of you fine people can give me more answers than my yoga instructors.

I've been practicing yoga for about 6 years on and off but got much more serious about it in the last year and a half.  Downward dog has always been one of my favorite postures as far as a feeling of balance and well-being, that is up until about 6 months ago.  Something in my left shoulder seems to be blocking my arm from achieving the proper external rotation.  You know how when you rotate externally and pull your shoulders away from your ears, it gives a sensation almost like you can feel your joints going deeper into themselves? Well on the left side it's like it gets painfully stuck and unable to go as deep.  Pain runs right along the top of my shoulder.  I don't feel it in forearm balances or dolphin pose, or even in plank.  Only in downward dog and sometimes in triangle.  It's highly frustrating as the pose now makes me feel lopsided and stuck whereas before it was a place of engagement and relaxation to return to in my practice.  I spoke to my yoga instructor about it and she brushed it off, saying I probably just had a little asymmetry in my body (not true, didn't have it before!), and that I appeared to be doing the posture properly and well.  Any insights into what might be going on and what I could do to remedy it?

664,Recently sprained ankle,Hi guys I sprained my ankle last week and can now finally walk on it slowly...was wondering what kind of yoga I can do that will be easy on my ankles.

665,Poses for the first time,"I just wanted to share that yesterday I was able to do side crow for the first time. I’m not trying to brag but mostly to share the excitement and confidence that comes with it. Any time we manage to push our boundaries and do something we’ve never done before feels awesome. Some months ago I got bird of paradise and both I managed to do thanks to Leslie Fightmaster specific vídeos working towards each pose. So if you are intermediatish and looking for an awesome online guidance that will help you achieve poses you didn’t think you would, take a look at her videos I find her really useful and inspiring.",yoga
666,A birthday gift for a yoga instructor / girlfriend,"I appologise if I'm trespassing with a silly question.

I was recently introduced to yoga by my new girlfriend who happens to be a certified yoga instructor. Her birthday is coming up very soon and since yoga is a huge part of her life I figured it would be nice to get her something related. As a complete beginner I'm afraid to get a tacky or useless thing. 

She teaches / practices at two different places and at home. I'm concidering getting her a watercolor yoga mat (http://dvayoga.ru/d/860821/d/akvarel_yogamat.jpg). Perhaps 4mm version. Maybe with a different picture. Is it a good idea or is it tacky and unprofessional to have a painted mat? 

I also have other options... One is a bonsai tree, but she has a cat which will probably destroy it at once. 

Please let me know if there's something you'd love to receive as a gift. Something with meaning. A fun activity for the day is organised, but I'd like to get something lasting too. 

I realise it's not exactly a yoga question, but I'm sure almost everyone here has a yoga instructor, so it might be a useful discussion. Thanks everyone. ",yoga

If I'm doing any forward bends I can tuck my chin to create a sort of tension that runs down my whole spine which makes me think it might have something to do with my nerves.

670,Jade Harmony mats... shedding/crumbling?,"I really like the texture of the Jade Harmony mats. My first lasted about 2 years before I found myself covered in mat crumbs post-savasana, my next one lasted just a year.

(I do hot yoga, but prefer not to use a mat towel, because I always seem to end up slipping and almost wrenching an elbow. I have zero interest in one of those towels you have to wet down pre-practice, they gross me out.)

Can anyone recommend a more-durable textured mat? Thanks!",yoga
671,Side crow question,"Hi all! I have a question about side crow. I’ve tried to figure it out via Google but I keep coming up with mixed answers. Hopefully someone can help. 

I’m really just wondering if your legs are meant to be resting ONLY on one arm, or if they can rest along both triceps. 

In a recent class I took, the instructor had us place our legs along both triceps, (of course with both knees pointing in one direction). But today, a different instructor had us balance our legs on one arm, leaving no part of our body touching the other arm. Does anyone know what the proper way of doing this pose is? ",yoga
672,Trying to pinpoint hip mobility problem,"What a great sub! I’ve been practicing various forms of yoga for years and am interested now in improving poses by understanding the mechanics of my body better. My biggest issue is a specific tightness of my hips in one direction - they don’t want to rotate in any way that lifts my leg up and to the side. This is most noticeable in frog pose - if I keep my knees bent only 90deg and my feet flexed, I can barely open my knees as wide as my mat before they just seem to stop. I can sometimes breathe and move slowly back and forth enough to settle a couple inches wider, but this has not improved much over many years of practice. I have decent internal/external rotation otherwise, but tight hip flexors and poor glute activation  that I am working a lot on. 

Any ideas on what I can work on to open my groin/hips/whatever is going on more?  ",yoga
673,How to feel about teacher being repeatedly late?,"Hi everyone!
So my absolute favorite yoga teacher - who is always amazing and whose style really suits me - is almost always 5 to 10 minutes late for class, and I don't know how to feel about it. On the one hand I know that Ivm always calm and satisfied at the end of her classes, regardless of their length, and since she is such a good teacher I won't stop going to her classes anyway. On the other hand it feels a bit disrespectful on her part and I can't help feeling irritated about it at times, which isn't a very nice starting point for a class. I have been thinking about notifying the studio about the issue so they maybe can speak to her and/or make adjustments to her working schedule as to give her more time between classes. I don't however want to risk them sacking her or her being offended /fed up and deciding to quit. She seems very genuine and present when she is teaching, but I also do pay good money for the classes and it feels a little bit like I'm systematically not given my money's worth... 

Any suggestions on how to go about changing this situation? Or should I just work on myself and my own reactions to it?",yoga
674,Recently experiencing intense energy while doing heart opening stretch. Normal?,"I don't actually do yoga but am not sure where else to ask this question. I felt what I experience as some energy stuckness in my chest and stomach and recently began giving it a good stretch. I spread my arms out wide, arch my back, and push my chest and stomach out until it feels a little uncomfortable and then hold my breath at the top of the stretch for 3-5 seconds before exhaling and returning to my normal posture. During of after the exhale I often experience a disorienting, but mostly pleasant, feeling that is difficult to describe. It feels like an energy release that puts me very much in my body and my thoughts often completely stop altogether for up to a minute. At it's most intense I lose awareness of my environment for a few seconds. The experience can be quite intense sometimes and I have to make sure that I am near a place where I can sit or lay down when I do this now because I'm afraid it might make me fall over.

No idea what is happening here, but would love some insight if anyone else has experienced this or might be able to point me somewhere with more information. Mostly want to make sure I'm not doing anything that might be dangerous to me as I've never experienced this before.",yoga
675,Sacral Chakra,"I would not say that I practice yoga, but I have used a few videos from YouTube and have purchased a few dvds. After looking through this subreddit for a few months, I researched chakras and I think I have a blockage in the sacral chakra. 

I am a 29 year old female, married in April of this year, and I have only had sex with my new husband once a month since February ... We are healthy and happy so there's no physical reason why we shouldn't be in one another's arms all the time. I just haven't had any thought to have sex and when we do, it's random and he always initiates. 

I would like anyone's thoughts/opinions and any poses or other sources I can read/use to help my sacral chakra. 

Thank you for your time. ",yoga
676,How do I make sure I have a well rounded home practice?,"I am lucky to be close to an amazing studio, but there are many times when I must practice at home. My problem is that when I practice at home, it feels disjointed. I'm not sure how to flow from one place to the other, and I feel kind of like I'm leaving out a lot of important poses and transitions.

Do any of you have any rules of thumb that you follow when you practice at home? How do you make sure you're not leaving anything out?",yoga
677,Yoga for the flexibility challenged,"I’m sorry if this was in the FAQ but I couldn’t find anything particularly on this topic. I’m not very flexible but am trying to get into yoga. For example, when I reach straight down I can maybe reach halfway down my shins on a good day. I recently went to a yoga class and it seemed like a lot of the poses assumed you had a certain amount of flexibility. I couldn’t do a lot of the things because of that. I was wondering if there is any poses or type of yoga that doesn’t require as much flexibility so I can work my way up. Thanks for your time. 

TLDR I’m not very flexible and want to find a way I can get into yoga without being left out of some of the poses. 

Edit: Wow! I’m overwhelmed by everyone’s response. Thank you guys so much for the insane amount of advice and support. I really appreciate it. Some of your stories have really inspired me to keep at it and hopefully I’ll reach a level of flexibility I never imagined. I can’t wait to reach new heights. ",yoga

680,"My left shoulder needs surgery, but doesn't hurt unless I use it. Are there any yoga videos I can use without a lot of modifications?","Like the title says, I need surgery on my left shoulder. I wrecked the Labrum, and the surgery isn't most likely until a couple of months from now. Fortunately I'm able to move my arm pretty freely below 45 degrees, and less freely above 45. I can't put any pressure on it, so even a regular plank hurts a bit.

Are there any yoga videos I can follow mindlessly? I haven't done enough yoga to make my own routines and still get that great sense of calmness, so I'd much rather follow a video. Do any of you got links to some videos I might use? I'm not picky! A crappy yoga video is a lot better than no yoga video at all.",yoga
681,Resources for a deeper practice without certification?,"I want to deepen my practice, specifically by learning about Balance &amp; Alignment in the body as well as how to keep a hollow body.

Where can I learn this without having to pay for a certification? Is there a specific book or website that will cover this? ",yoga
682,Tight hips after hot yoga?,"I’ve been going to hot yoga vinyasa classes about three times a week for the past six months and have noticed that my hips have been getting tighter.  

I took ten days off a couple of weeks ago and noticed that the tightness in my hips was completely gone. I’ve since returned to class and the pain is now back.

I initially thought it was other exercises I was doing that was causing the tightness (running, cycling, circuit training), so thought the yoga would help release the tightness in the hips. My husband also goes to the classes and is noticing the same kind of thing. 

Is it possible for hot yoga to cause tightness in the hips? I feel like maybe because your body is so warm, it’s possible to push harder than you really should and cause injury/strain. 

Has anyone else experienced this at all?",yoga

I don't feel like most other places I go to are like this at all.

Even at a party many people keep to themselves after doing the required small talk.

If you are feeling lonely or want to make friends, definitely check out a studio.

691,Ahimsa thoughts,"Hey guys, first post on this sub so be gentle! 

I have been practicing yoga for a year now so still a total beginner. Recently I have been reading a lot of yoga philosophy and to me the principle of ahimsa translates directly to veganism. I follow enough yoga teachers on Instagram etc to know that many eat meat or at least dairy, and I wonder if I am missing something? 

To me, the ability to practice what you preach is essential for your credibility. I am sure I'm missing something here and would like some help understanding what I perceive to be somewhat of a hypocrisy. 

Full disclosure: I am a longtime vegetarian who has recently been making an effort to exclude any animal products from my diet as I realise they are just as morally and environmentally detrimental as eating flesh",yoga
692,Manduka Mat for bad knees?,"My physical therapist recommended yoga to help with my recovery from my most recent knee surgery, but I’ve found that it’s been making my knees feel worse. A teacher and some friends have suggested it might be my mat, which is a secondhand Gaiam I’ve had for a few years now (I know, when I write it out it sounds obvious, but I’m new). The internet has recommended the Manduka Pro mat for extra cushioning and stability. I’m not a super yogi by any means but I’m willing to pay for a premium mat to protect my joints and I like the lifetime guarantee, since I do a lot of extended traveling for work (weeks and months) and I need a consistent mat on which I can do some yoga and PT exercises.
