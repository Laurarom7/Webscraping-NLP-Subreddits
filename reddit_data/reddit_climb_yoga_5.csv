I did have to rest on a cam after pumping out, so it wasn't clean. Gotta keep working on my endurance for that. In terms of moves though, I made some really good ones to get up some committing sections.

Anyone else made some progress lately?

11,I have changed my view of progression to working V2-V5 downclimb beta instead of progressing V6+ at my gym. Anyone else do this?,"I am just curious if anyone else settled into this method of challenging themselves and would love to get a discussion going. As far as my rationale goes it can be summed up pretty quickly...

**I have never liked crimps.** 

Anytime I had to take a break from climbing to heal it was because of crimps and because of pushing progression. I always felt like a majority of the challenge in the V6+ realm comes from shrinking the holds and forcing crimps, which leads to finger pain, which can lead to a forced rest. 

I will work them sometimes, but I am not too attached to progressing in that realm.

&amp;nbsp;

**Two things have always stuck out from my research on finger strength and injuries:** 

* Muscles build fast (just think how quick you progressed once you started developing that forearm strength) 
* It takes years to build pulley/tendon strength (aka you get to V6 before your pulleys/tendons are ready)

What ends up happening is people get hooked and build that muscle fast which gets them to the high grades quickly. Then shit gets crimpy and they start to hurt or tear their pulleys/tendons ([usually the A2 pulley - some great visuals in this article](http://cruxcrush.com/2013/10/24/climber-problems-the-a2-pulley-strain/)). They either wise up and take a rest or push it to hard and blow a pulley. 

Either way they are out of commission. Apparently training on a hangboard can help, but the takeaway for me was always that the risk of finger injury just plain skyrockets when you get to crimpland. 

I never really wanted to develop a training/hangboard regimen just so I could do more routes with holds that I didn't like so...I didn't. Climbing was just my fun, consistent workout and avoiding crimps and consistent progression became part of that.

&amp;nbsp;

Eventually I started downclimbing routes so I could keep getting a good pump and breaking a sweat in my fun workouts. I pretty quickly realized

&gt; **""holy shit, this is two betas per route on all of the holds are ones actually LIKE""**

and have been doing it for some time now. Nobody else at my gym ever talks about downclimb beta though so in my curiosity I came to good old reddit.

Soooo yea, anyone else stop trying to go higher and higher on grades but **still challenge themselves by treating a downclimb like an actual route?** 

Downclimbing is obviously also a safe, knee and ankle preserving way to get off the wall which is nice, but I am really curious if anyone thinks about coming down as a route and challenge unto itself.


Cheers if you made it through this overly long post (I didn't plan on writing this much but it happened). Happy Friday!

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

I hate crimps. Crimps lead to hurt fingers. Hurt fingers mean I have to rest. Having to rest means I cant climb. 

I started avoiding crimps by staying below V6 and thinking of downclimbs as entirely separate routes, striving to be able to go up and down any route I like.

This is a long winded way of finding out if anyone else thinks this way because I haven't bumped into anyone at my gym that does.

17,Five Ten Hiangle alternatives,"Hi all,

​

I have been using five ten Hiangles for almost 1.5 years, and having been loving them as they fit my foot profile really well; however, the only drawback im finding is the heel cup as there is a small amount of dead space in it, so I am looking for some opinions on an alternative pair of climbing shoes.

I mainly boulder indoors, with an occassional outdoor trip, and I  don't have a chance to try alot of variety since I am from australia where we don't get a lot of variety in shoe brands, but I am looking into the evolv x1, scrapa vsr or scarpa v.

Does anyone have any experience with these shoes and confirm if they are similar to the foot shape of the hiangles, or can suggest any other pair of shoes that are similar to the hiangles with a narrow profile.

23,"Forearm popped, no pain though","So I was turning around a corner. My left arm was holding onto a nice hold, carrying some portion of my mass and probably a bit of my moment too, when I felt a peculiar ‘pop’ through the middle of my forearm. I, of course, stopped bouldering immediately. 

That was about an hour or so ago. I still don’t feel any pain, or even soreness (it’s just as sore as my other forearm... trying to get back into climbing after being unable to in the summer), but I’m still concerned about my forearm.

I retain full (painless) mobility of my entire arm, including wrist, fingers, etc. At the moment it happened, I had been climbing for a bit more than an hour, and had warmed up appropriately.

Any ideas of what the pop could have been? Should I be concerned? I’m in college, and tuition is a thing, so I’d prefer to stay out of a clinic if I can. Still, I don’t want to risk an injury. I’m thinking about giving it 3 days or a week just to be sure everything’s fuckin’-a in the grabber.

However, I believe fingers are completely different and I never know when a bit of pain is fine for climbing or if it could lead to a serious injury.

I started bouldering two years ago and I never had any particular pain, although recently (about 3 months ago), I started pushing myself with some more difficult problems like 6b+/6c. Since then, I started experiencing some pain in the ""flashy part"" of my fingers. It usually disappear completely after warming up, but it sometimes remain until the end of the training. When I'm not training, it also happens that a very specific movement of a finger, or a very localised area, feels particularly painful, like pinching my thumb and finger while holding my hand behind my back!

My question is, based on your experience, when should I start worrying, and what do you suggest doing when the pain a ""dangerous one""?

65,Shoulder Dislocation Bouldering," 

Hi guys,

In 2015  I dislocated my shoulder whilst falling awkwardly out of a handstand, the shoulder fell back in without too much effort although later that day I re-dislocated it which took a larger amount of effort to relocate. After the accident I was advised by an orthopaedic surgeon to work on strengthening the ligaments and muscles around the shoulder, and surgery might be avoidable. Over the past three years at times it has left unstable, but I have slowly worked on physical therapy till now where it has been feeling almost pain free and feeling stable . Since starting bouldering I’ve worked even more on strengthening my shoulders, understanding the stress they are under due to the sport. This in mind, while on a wall last Sunday I’ve had my left arm extended at 60 degrees and crimped down hard next thing I know I’m lying on the mat with my shoulder dislocated. I was able to manipulate my body against the mat as I could feel it would go back in. My question; is there any possibility of recovering from this without a shoulder stabilisation surgery and continue climbing? Does anyone have experience or understanding of this procedure are there any risks involved such as loss of mobility or re-occurring problems?  Would surgery with physio along with stretch therapy result in the best outcome? Or should it be avoided?

I’ve had my MRI I’m waiting for the report and will be seeing an orthopaedic surgeon in the next couple days. Would really appreciate opinion on if a conservative treatment could work. 

Thanks for your time, 

Sorry i'm not sure where the most appropriate place would be to make this post.

98,Rock Over Climbing reopening on September 1st after fire,"If you climb in or around Manchester, you've probably heard that Rock Over Climbing has been closed recently due to a fire.

We didn't actually catch fire, but the building next door to us was so badly damaged by the fire that it's had to be completely demolished.

It's going to take us in total about a week and a half to clear up after the smoke damage. This is also going to include a reset of the entire centre as each hold has to soaked in Benky and then jetwashed to get them completely clean.

Some of the GB Climbing Team have very kindly offered to come in and help us reset this week, but it's still going to be a big job setting over 200 problems in 5 days!

The photo is what used to be our hold store, and you can see the demolished building through the hole. This is actually a result of part of the other buildings roof crashing down on us during the fire. There's a full write up of the damage on our website if you'd like to know more - [https://www.rockoverclimbing.co.uk/reopening-on-saturday-1st-september/](https://www.rockoverclimbing.co.uk/reopening-on-saturday-1st-september/)

We'd also like to say a massive thank you to the Greater Manchester Fire &amp; Rescue Service, they responded with 10 fire engines and it's only because of their amazing effort that we're still here!

Let me know if you have any questions, it'll be great to see some of you at the centre once we've reopened!

121,Verical mind: a book for climbers who stopped improving and lost having fun,"Climbing is a strange. For me it is purely a hobby, I am not even a good climber by any means, not internationally, not locally, not at my gym and not even among my friends, however it is still a big part of my life and my identity. This has led to numerous problems, for example fear of failure and even unhealthy amount of time spent climbing or training for climbing, to the point where I would feel frustrated to skip a training session to have a beer with friends.

This book will adrress many such problems and ways to overcome these crippling habits. I want to improve my climbing, I also want to have a healthier relationship with my favorite activity and I want to have more fun and less negative emotioms and thoughts when I am out climbimg, so I had a very open mind while reading this book hence it reflected greatly to me. I found many areas to fix on my approach to climbing and life in general with great tips and advices how to achieve that.

It is absolutelly great read that I would recommend to pretty much everyone who is willing to improve their lives or athletic performance. This is a climbing book so most examples are focused on climbing and most issues discussed are climbing related, but almost everything can be translated to any other althletic activity or life in general.

136,Asian Games Women's Final recap,"They started the day with speed. This was my first time watching a full speed comp start to finish so I wasn't sure wth was going on, other than that the person who tags the thing at the top first wins. I thought they were going to just rank athletes by time, but they did a full set of head-to-head races to determine the 1-6 rank. The rankings after the speed round was:

Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Sa | 1 | - | - | 1
Marlenova | 2 | - | - | 2
Lee | 3 | - | - | 3
Ito | 4 | - | - | 4
Kim | 5 | - | - | 5
Noguchi | 6 | - | - | 6


The bouldering round really separated out the competitors. On F1, Lee and Marlenova couldn't even reach the zone(bonus) hold. Kim had trouble with F2 because of her height. F3 was a big disappointment on the setters because the beta was broken. Everyone who topped F3 used the zone hold only as a foot; they didn't even bother to tag it with a hand just for the bonus point and instead just took it to the top. Marlenova was the only one to not top this, and she touched the zone hold with her hands when she tried to dyno to it out of desperation. F4 was similar. The setters probably wanted the climbers to sideways-dyno into a double-gaston. No one did that, and instead just went straight up. This put the climbers in a weird spot where they had to basically downclimb a move to tag the zone hold, and a couple of them almost fell doing so.


Climber | F1 | F2| F3 | F4 | Total
-|-|-|-|-|-
Noguchi | T | T | T | T | 4T4z
Ito | T | T | T | z | 3T4z
Kim | T | z | T | z | 2T4z
Sa | z | T | T | z | 2T4z
Lee | - | z | T | z | 1T3z
Marlenova | - | z | - | - | 0T1z


Rankings after Speed+Boulder:


Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Sa | 1 | 4 | - | 4
Noguchi | 6 | 1 | - | 6
Ito | 4 | 2 | - | 8
Marlanova | 2 | 6 | - | 12
Kim | 5 | 3 | - | 15
Lee | 3 | 5 | - | 15


I don't know how tiebreakers work but whatever rule they use, Kim beats Lee, so Lee went first. This was 4th day on climbing for these athletes after 3 straight days of quals. They all looked tired. Lee fought the pump as much as she could before falling around halfway up. Marlenova was clearly already out of gas towards the end of the bouldering round, and ended up only making a handful of moves up the wall. Kim took it to the top like a champ. She didn't look that tired either. The final move to the top hold was a dyno and she caught it with room to spare. She probably knew this guaranteed her a medal as she got a bit emotional celebrating at the top. Ito made good progress until her knee popped and she fell. I got a little uneasy watching them climb this route because there were lots of tweaky-looking heel hooks - those that you bring your foot up to your waist height and your leg goes sideways horizontal. Ito was in the middle of a leftward cross move with her right leg in this position and ended up getting injured. She was clutching her right knee as she got lowered and remained on the ground even after getting lowered. She had to get carried out on a board. Noguchi looked like she had a pretty good chance of taking it to the top as well but looks like the fatigue finally caught up to her. At this point, Sa was guaranteed a silver and needed to best Noguchi's position for the gold. She looked like she was well on her way until she fell just about where Ito fell. I think she made a mistake and slipped. Sa herself looked pretty disappointed as well.


Climber | Hold
- | -
Kim | Top
Noguchi | 40+
Sa | 37+
Ito | 36+
Lee | 23+
Marlenova | 12+


Final standings :


Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Noguchi | 6 | 1 | 2 | 12
Sa | 1 | 4 | 3 | 12
Kim | 5 | 3 | 1 | 15
Ito | 4 | 2 | 4 | 32
Marlenova | 2 | 6 | 6 | 72
Lee | 3 | 5 | 5 | 75


I still don't know how tiebreakers work because Noguchi won gold. I thought Sa would win gold based on her first place qual finish but I guess that's not how the rules are written. Also, 2-6-6 looks worse than 3-5-5 but again, that's just how the points are calculated.


The men's finals will start in a bit but I won't be watching that as I have other things to do. My guess is Tomoa gold, Chon silver, Kokoro bronze.",climbing

138,Advice for building mind-body connection?,"I've been a desk jockey my whole life. Due to life circumstance, I was never exposed to sports or really physical activity much at all and used video games as escape, and eventually my career. Luckily I never got significantly overweight, but I was never active or in shape and my hand-eye coordination is good only in as much as a mouse and keyboard is involved. If you asked me or my family you would have just said I was ""never into all that active stuff"".

​

In 2018, my life goal has been to change all that, because I didn't think it was true - just circumstantial. Earlier this year I trained for a 10K and started heavy weight lifting - hating the former but expanding the latter to 5 days a week. I've gone out hiking, kayaking, and I bike almost every day. In May, I started rock climbing, and fell in love. As of today I'm in the best shape of my life, I feel strong and capable in ways I didn't know possible (but with many years of gains to be had). I've been extensively reading articles and books on climbing as well as the two reddit climbing forums.

​

Obviously I'm still very very new and there are tons of ""noob gains"" to be had by ""just climbing"" (which I do as often as my body allows, which appears to be more and more). But I can tell I'm being hugely held back by two things: lack of trust in my body to perform and lack of mind-body connection, and I would like some advice on how to improve these things, especially from people who have overcome them.

​

I'm very cerebral and in my thoughts a lot (also have moderate-to-severe ADD). Awareness of where my body is in space and what it's doing is usually very low, and I am currently putting most of my training effort into watching/focusing on my body parts (feet, core) to make sure they're doing what I want them to do. In my normal life I'm very clumsy and bump into things, trip, and knock things over all the time. I suck at throwing/catching things and am just generally ungraceful.

​

More importantly, I just don't trust my body. I am often observing these minute hesitations in my daily life for things that I assume I can't do, and I have to remind myself to at least give it a try (ex: lifting my weight to climb on top of something, picking up a heavy thing, leveraging something that is stuck). In climbing, I frequently notice that I won't instinctively try to stand up on a hold because I don't think my legs can do it. I SUCK at reaching holds that require a big push into a grab because the confidence isn't there, and I do a wimpy attempt and peel off after hanging around below the hold for several seconds agonizing about how I won't be able to do it. Logically, I know I \*could\* do it. But I'm always pre-convincing myself that I can't. I'm reading The Rock Warrior's Way now and I feel like I'm doing basically the opposite of everything he recommends. I set myself up for failure by looking at things without objective framing and without confidence. I see everything as being too hard, too scary, above my level.

​

How can I unlearn a lifetime (30 years) of believing I'm weak and incapable? Do you have any advice for how you developed confidence or equanimity in a rock climbing setting, especially for formerly lazy uncoordinated gumbies?",climbing

However, recently I taught a private lesson for a person that I just described in the title, and it’s a little difficult for me because he is not able to do the same exercises that kids or young adults are typically able to do at a beginner level. So far I’ve had him do pull-ups using an assisted pull-up machine(taking off a lot of weight), and done some relatively easy core-work like knee raises because he can’t do sit ups or Russian twists or anything like that.  He knows a good deal of technique but most of the time he doesn’t have the confidence in himself to try things that I suggest while he’s climbing on the wall, so I think that if his strength is increased he will have more confidence in himself while climbing.

159,The Asian Games are underway. Quals are over.,"I rarely watch plastic climbing comps but I'm stuck indoors, it's hot AF outside, and this was on TV anyway. I caught a bit of the bouldering quals and a good chunk of the lead quals. Speed quals were already over. Because I don't watch plastic comps I'm not aware of any other comp that has adopted the Olympic-style combined format yet. At least for me, this is a good pre-run to see how that format will play itself out on a larger scale. What's weird here is that there is a medal for speed, medal for combined (lead+boulder+speed), and a medal for speed relay (not sure how this even works) but that's just the Asian Games. The Olympics will only have the combined medal.


Here are the [men's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-men-combined/) and [women's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-women-combined/) after quals. The scores are calculated by your rank in each discipline multiplied, with the lowest score winning. We'll have to consider that the level of competition here has huge disparity. That being said, there's a big gap between the podium and those outside. Top 6 made finals. Not surprising to see that the two Japanese and two Korean climbers get four spots, then someone else fairly well-rounded (Au &amp; Lee), and someone who blitzed up the speed wall (Khaibullin &amp; Marlenova, coincidentally both from Kazakhstan). It seems like the way the points are calculated, unless you really shit the bed in lead and boulder, winning speed will get you in the finals. I wasn't sure how I felt about it initially but after seeing the table, I'm okay with a ""discipline winner"" basically getting a spot in the finals. 


Finals are tomorrow and they're starting with speed. No indication on which of lead or boulder will be next but if they follow the quals order then it'll be boulder first. I'd be interested to see how the single day finals will turn out logistically for the climbers. That's a lot of high-intensity, high-stakes climbing to do on your 4th day on.",climbing

Climbing rope is usually rated for 10 years based on what I’ve read. 

Can anyone give a reason why this would be unsafe to use?

197,"Finally pinpointed the cause of my achey fingers and swollen PIP joints... and it was belaying, not climbing!","Wanted to share my story in case anyone else is suffering. I'll try to keep it as short as possible!

Background:
I have been experiencing some pain and swelling on the fingers of my left hand, focused on the joints rather than the pulleys. During a recent climbing trip it got pretty bad, and I realized something was really off when I couldn't fully close the fingers in my left hand while my right was normal. 

This was frustrating and perplexing because I always warm up thoroughly before climbing, avoid excessive crimping and sketchy pockets, rest often, and take really good care of my fingers on days off. I assumed it was an overuse thing and took a few days off in hopes it would calm down. 

Realization hits:
After a few days off climbing and lots of finger warm ups on the hike in, the first 3 warm ups felt pretty good. On climb 4 my partner tried something harder and took a long fall. As usual, I got lifted off the ground a few feet, but ascended the rope as high as I could so he could boink back to the route. The moment I gripped the rope to pull up on my gri gri, the pain in my left hand came back in full force. It hit me that this was probably the cause and I decided to do a little research. 

After talking to some experienced climbers in my community, I found out that gripping the rope like this puts a lot of force on the collateral ligaments of your joints. This is apparently NO BUENO but it explains my symptoms perfectly. The collateral ligaments are not strengthened by climbing like our pulleys are, so they are very sensitive to injury.

Proposed solution:
The first thing I did was stop ascending the rope and in just a week my left hand already feels way better. However, ascending the rope is still essential when belaying on steep routes, so I've ordered an ascender and will see if that is more comfortable for my joints.  

If anyone has had a similar experience I'd love to hear about it!

TLDR: Recurring pain and joint swelling on left hand (ring and middle fingers). Figured out this is from ascending the rope after catching long falls while lead belaying. No longer ascending rope by hand (instantly alleviated symptoms) and will be trying out belaying with an ascender.",climbing

I'm going on two years of climbing, and I am keen on programming. In an attempt to intersect my hobbies, I have created a climbing app for the Red River Gorge in Kentucky (nearest to home &amp; starting small). This is a route guide app! You may be asking yourselves, ""how is this different than Mountain Project?"" Well, MP has some serious UX flaws, but it makes up for these with its wealth of data. You'll find that my app, ""Redpoint"", greatly improves upon MP's UX, and I've added a feature which allows for users to search for routes based upon climbing style. Do you like slab? Search for slabs! Feeling the need for pump? Search for pumpy! Anyways, this app works great in coordination with MP for an awesome climbing experience.

203,Thoughts on Tenaya Tarifas and Black Diamond Shadows,"Absolutely love my Tarifas... just amazing shoe overall.  I completely ignore the smell, which could be the only con if it's a thing for you.  I think how well the shoe performs completely outweighs the smell issue.  I wear size 8.

Yesterday I received 2 pairs of Shadows, 9 and 9.5.  Althought I only traversed for 5 minutes with the 9s, I decided not to keep either one.  Main reason:  they just look cheaply made.  You can see glue residue all over the shoe, kind of like when you glue something on a piece of paper, have put too much glue, and glue comes out when you stick the thing down.  Also, the fit was just plain weird (I understand this is a very personal thing, but still thought worth mentioning):  the mouth of the shoe is very small, so you struggle to get your foot in, not because the shoe itself is tight, but because your foot doesn't fit through the mouth.  Once on, the shoes felt very tight midfoot down, and very big midfoot up.  Also, the heel had a lot of air.

My 2 cents... obviously some people out there love the Shadows, just not for me, and wanted to share. 

Lastly, so freaking excited about getting my Oasis.",climbing

206,(Overcoming) Fear of falling on trad pro?,"**When did you first feel comfortable risking a fall on your own trad pro?**

Or after your first surprise whip on a nut, then you go “oh, it actually works” and then confidence goes up? 

I don’t *like* it, but I’m ok falling on a sport bolt. I trust my rope, trust my belayer. Apparently I trust the hardware and the rock. I also trust the engineers who tested the slings/harness/biners/etc and those guys also test the nuts and cams... but nobody tests placement - unless you fall on it!",climbing

214,Cracking fingers: supplements or other tips?,"Hi folks, apologies if this has already been discussed but didn't see anything too similar.
I've been climbing for about 6 months, bouldering indoors twice or three times per week. My finger joints are often slightly painful in between climbs. I've noticed my knuckles crack a lot more than they used to, and it's a bit disconcerting.
I've been using a stretchy plastic ring device for exercising my fingers, opening rather than closing, as I was under the impression this was an appropriate exercise for generally strengthening the ligaments and supportive tissue. But it's not really helping so far (albeit only a couple of weeks use).
I'm kind of worried I might give myself some kind of arthritis, eventually. 

I wondered if anyone would recommend something like cod liver oil or another supplement for joint health. Is this something that's likely to help? Or any other tips really.

220,Broken Talus (Ankle) Bone,"Last Sunday I slipped on a slab at my local bouldering wall, and my right foot unfortunately hit a giant jug close to the ground before I landed on the mat. As I have hypermobility in my joints and the foot had essentially done a 360, I assumed it was dislocated. Big shock when the X-Ray came back and the nurse tells me I have broken my talus bone. I should find out tomorrow exactly how bad it is and whether I will need surgery. For the time being I'm non-weight bearing; I was too short for the usual armpit crutches, so I'm making do (poorly) with elbow crutches, hopping about with extreme cabin fever.

All the broken talus bone stories I read on the internet are dismal, and I'm terrified. I only started climbing 10 months ago, and I've fallen in love with the sport - I ran track, fell and cross country previously but never felt the same passion or drive to train as I do with climbing now. Emotionally I struggle when I can't exercise, so the next six months to rest-of-my-life will be tough.

Can anyone give me some hope for the future? Even if you had a rough time with a talus break, is there any way you can put a positive spin on your story for me so I can at least have some belief I will recover? I'm a fit 20 year old female, I only fell from about two metres and I don't weight very much (very short). Do these work in my favour? Will I ever get back to the same level of movement again?

263,Tracking climbing volume/ V Points for lead climbing,"Hello all,

I could need some advice on how to track my climbing progress, especially regarding to training volume. I used to track the time spend at the gym only but found this doesn't really mean much. Sometimes I belay much more than I climb, sometimes I spend 30min on one crux, sometimes I speed through lot's of easy climbs in that time.

I like the idea of the V-Points in bouldering where you (my understanding) add up the points for each boulder but don't really see how to apply that to rout climbing.

We use UIAA scale in my gym, but I feel just adding up the grades won't work. Climbing an 8 should ""worth more"" than 2 5's in my opinion.

Any thoughts on this, or maybe someone already has come up with a points system I could use?

Meeting with the Doc

The urologist explained that I needed to go into this knowing it was not a reversible procedure.  He said that even thought it is reversible, it sometimes is impossible due to the anatomy.  After he inspected my junk, he said I was a good candidate for having the procedure done right there in his office.  There is the option to go to a hospital, where they would fully sedate you, etc, so you CAN do that if you want.  The way I had the procedure done was $500, and it was covered by my insurance.

Without getting too technical, he basically explained make a small incision, find each tube, and for each one (there are two), he would cut the tube, tie it, and cauterize it.  He explained the whole thing would be about 15 minutes, and that the only painful part would be when he clamps and pulls the tubes out so he can do his thing.  He said the pain would be very similar to getting kicked in the nuts.  I have never thought I would feel happy about basically paying someone $500 for kicking me in the nuts twice.  The main thing that stayed with me from this consult was a question he asked me: ""how many kids do you have?""... he didn't ask ""do you have kids?"" ... They need to make sure you are fully committed to this, so once I explained to him our reasons why, I was good to go.  In my research, I read about some doctors making their patients attend a ""class"" to ensure that's what they want, or flat out refuse to do the procedure... makes sense.

Day before the procedure

Not much to say here other than I manscapped EVERYTHING, and wanted to wait until the day before so it would be nice and fresh. :)  This is something that needs to be done, so if you don't do it yourself, someone will do it for you... I wasn't cool with trusting someone shaving my balls (but somehow I was okay with someone cutting them open... hrmm).

V-day

I went into the room.  I was asked to take off my pants, and lie on a narrow bed.  About 5 minutes later, a female nurse came in and put iodine all over my stuff... it was very, very cold, and yes, it tickled.  Before the iodine, she took 3 strips of, what looked like to me but I'm sure wasn't, masking tape, and she taped my penis to my stomach (to get it out of the way for the procedure).  I know, weird.  A lot of thoughts went through my mind at this moment... thoughts that I will not share here, but you can imagine some of them, I'm sure.

After about 10 minutes of being in the room with my pants down and the cold iodine just getting colder, the doc came in with 2 female nurses.  Hmm.  Ok, whatevs.  He asked if I'm ready... ""any last words?"" he says.  I say no, and he starts.  He used a small needle to numb where the cut was going to be... this didn't hurt at all.  He made the incision, which I did not feel, and started moving stuff around in there.  I could feel stuff moving inside (imagine noodles being moved around, I guess).  He pulls a section of the first tube out, cuts, ties, and cauterizes (I couldn't see, he was talking to me the whole time).  The only part where I felt ""some"" pain (probably 2 out of 10) was when he said I would:  when he had to ""look"" for the tube.  As he told me he was basically done with the first one, I see smoke come up from down here... yes, I saw, and smelled, my balls being cauterized.  Again, no pain during any of this.  He said he was going to try to use the same incision to find the next tube, which he was able to, and basically repeated the first half it all over again.  Before I knew it, it was done.  THE WORST PART of this whole thing was the anticipation of that sharp ""getting kicked in the balls"" pain, which never came... I was afraid I was going to feel the pain hit me, and buckle or something, but nothing.  A mild discomfort here and there, but that was it.  I had my hands over my forehead the whole time, and during the second half of the procedure, I was actually starting to fall asleep a little bit.  He stitched me up, and I was on my way out, on my feet.

The following sections are directly from my phone, as I took notes daily for a few days after the procedure:

V-day:  currently in car.  Pain is similar to the pain that resides after getting kicked in the balls.  3 out of 10.  Throwing up feeling.  Home.  bag of frozen green beans over underwear... doesn't help with pain at all.  7 hours after: no pain.

Day 1 after procedure:  absolutely no pain.  Did I even get anything done?

Day 2:  slight pain, but very milkd (1 out of 10, if that).  Same pain as if shit had been mangled down there, which it technically was.

Day 3:  swollen a bit, no pain.  Interesting feeling walking with balls bigger than what you're used to.  Belayed my friend for 3 hours, then traversed at the end of the gym:  ALL GOOD.

Days following until yesterday:  no pain, swelling going down daily.

Today (9 days after procedure):  I just came back from the rock climbing gym, where I had a full hard session.  Normal warm up, an hour plus of hard bouldering, and 45 minutes of endurance.  Absolutely no pain at all.

The only thing that resides is a slight discomfort when I jump up and down, as if jumping rope... that's it.  I have a follow up this upcoming Friday.

This is all!  Please feel free to ask any questions about the procedure, private message me, etc.  I think vasectomies are a taboo subject, and they shouldn't be.",climbing

I am a fairly new climber, but I often travel for work (sales) so I find myself in random cities on a regular basis. Since I am usually solo on my trips, I often pay for day passes at nearby climbing gyms to have a few hours of fun. Being a solo climber, I'm limited to auto belay routes and bouldering.

The crowd here seems to be well dispersed, so I was hoping anyone could chime in with recommendations for climbing gyms (within the lower 48) that have particularly interesting or challenging routes with auto belays.

I can usually tackle 5.9-5.10 routes, so I'm always on the lookout for routes in this difficulty range that present a nice challenge.

My hope is that there are some gyms out there that have particularly high routes (beyond 40ft) or varying pitches (within reason, given how an auto belay works).

I am hypermobile and have been practising for around 18 months now fairly regularly. I love yin practice and find this helps me a lot, however any intense vinyasa or strength-based classes leave me wiped out and often with joint pains in my shoulders and with tight and painful hamstrings. 

My question is: Are there supplemental exercises I should be doing to help with strengthening? One teacher has recommend climbing which I can access but would find it difficult to fit into my weekly schedule if I'm honest.

I joined the gym and started yoga classes about 5 weeks ago. I have been to yoga, body balance, spin, boxerfit, core stability, and now started taekwondo. I was living very much a sedantary life the past two years, sitting on the sofa, eating poorly, lots of crying an panic attacks... So for me to be moving now is a massive feat for me.

However, I was all well and good following the routine in class, then on YouTube at home, but they were all pretty active classes. Today I went to a midday class that was mainly senior citizens, it was also more introspective and meditative than I have been before. I don't know why, but the last few minutes of breathing, and hearing the instructor say So Hum and explain the meaning that we should accept ourselves as we are I lost it.

I started bawling. I finished the breathing and slight movements the best I could. But this was the first time I had an emotional connection whilst practicing, and I'm not sure I'm pleased with it. I don't know if I can face that eruption of overwhelming loss and incomprehension inside of me. I think I should, but I am kinda worried I'll unlocking thoughts and emotions that I am not capable of dealing with alone. My instructor gave me a massive hug after and made sure I was OK. But I'm not sure I can go back to that class.

442,Lotus posture and knee osteoarthritis,"A few month ago I saw my doctor due to knee pain and found I have a first light form of wear and tear induced osteoarthritis. With a week on medication the pain went away and with adjustments in exercise it does rarely come back.

Two weeks ago I went on a meditation retreat with 8 hours of sitting a day (and walks in between). On day 4 I noticed that the pain in my knees does not go away after getting off the cushion so I switched to a chair and it went OK subsequently. I used both a seiza bench and cushion for Burmese posture, so maybe one posture triggers it and the other does not, but as I sat in both positions I can not tell. In my two 1 hour sits that I do daily I use the bench and don't have any problems, but I guess that is also too little sitting to trigger it, as compared to the 8 hours on retreat.

Does anyone here have osteoarthritis in the knees, and if so, what is the best sitting posture (I know, chair is always an option)?

I read that most ""normal"" knee pain in lotus postures comes from immobile hip joints and overstressing the knees by bending them sideways. But if I mobilize my hips (gently and with due time of course), do you reckon I could get to a quarter/half/full lotus that does not stress my knees?

Background: The hot power yoga studio I attend offers modifications for most poses to make the pose more accessible or more challenging depending on individual preference. However, I can only make it to the studio once or maybe twice on the weekend because of needing child care. I can take yoga at the gym more often during the week because child care is available, but the classes at the gym tend to be really basic. I know there is plenty of growth to be had from working through basic postures, focusing on the breath, etc- but I still want to grow my practice and explore more intermediate/advanced poses. 

For example, if we’re doing sun salutations and the instructor is prompting knees down/baby cobra and breaking up the flow, would it be ok to move through chaturanga/up dog? Or if we’re doing a wide leg forward fold, moving into headstand? Just thinking of options that are offered in the studio.

459,Yoga deflation,"Hi guys, wondering and praying someone has experience or guidance...
I've been practicing yoga for around 18 months now and have always been left feeling rejuvenated after each session, I was doing an hours class each week and about 4 or 5 months ago subscribed to Yogaglo and practice at least every other day, however, over the last 3 or 4 weeks if I do any longer than 30 minutes 45 minutes max I start feeling incredibly unwell, fairness, dizziness, strong nausea and get very cold and shakey... any ideas? 
Not sure it's of any help but I'm 5ft 10 and 9st, my yoga tutor thinks it's due to low blood pressure but mines usually high.

460,Why buddha?,"I am both a yoga practitioner and a buddhist meditation practioner, and i find one thing very strange in western Yoga studios: lots of zen and buddha with NO hindu. I am confused by this; all yoga studios i have been to have statues of buddha, and are marketed as zen and inner peace yet i never see krishna, vishnu, brahma  or any other hindu deity? Is buddhism or zen much more marketable and palatable than Hinduism? I feel like you can easily slip buddha and zen stuff in without it feeling like religion and that is harder to do with Hindu. Most Yoga is rooted in Hinduism but western minds are scared of it and business owners aka studio owners decorate to make their customers feel good and choose zen over hindu.

462,Yoga Teacher Training fail.,"I heard of this awful thing happened to a friend at a yoga studio recently. This woman I know suffers from major depression, but tries to hide it out of pride. This person took a teacher training class. After fulfilling the major requirements and faithfully going to classes, she was short a couple of hours of volunteer teaching. She, admittedly, wasn't very good in the practice hours she did put in. Her classmates didn't attend a class she tried to set up. The studio felt they were so self important that they refused to give a signed certificate. After all, it might be bad PR for the studio if this person volunteered somewhere and the name of the studio was attached! The person became desperate enough to make a suicide attempt. After making something of a recovery, she asked for a second chance, so she could qualify to teach as a volunteer. The studio owner refused to make any concession and gave vague answers that amounted to ""no, tough luck."" The owner of the studio felt it was more important to protect the reputation of the studio at all costs. Why give a little boost of confidence to a suicidal mental patient? Better they kill themselves and everyone would be more comfortable. I guess they decided she was victim of the ""trance of scarcity,"" and her own negative thoughts, right? Why should it be up to the studio to help out and show some kindness? Sorry, I know the sarcasm probably doesn't come across well, but I'm disgusted at the hypocrisy of this place that dares to preach the yamas and niyamas and still pulls this crap.",yoga
463,"Finally, after 200+ handstand failures","I’ve been doing Yoga for about 2 and a half months now since incidentally ending up in a room where Yoga class was beginning. 

I’ve been a lifter for 4 and a half years, but had an accident (peritonitis) two years ago which resulted in having open body surgery that left me with a thick scar that stemmed from under the chest to above the groin. 

Since then, my core has been lagging behind which has affected my compound lifts; primarily squats as my core gives in whenever I try anything over 100kg.

The past two weeks I have been taking it easy with my lifting and focusing more towards yoga. 
After playing around with the crow pose and headstands against the wall, I decided would o to take things to the next level.

I’ve been averaging about 30-45 mins of handstand attempts 4x a week for these last two weeks. Within that time I would estimate that I have fallen over at least 200 times, with my right shoulder and gluteal taking most of the impacts. 

I tried over and over again, both before and after my workouts. Falling over and over again, I continued until I couldn’t any more. Well, today I finally did it for 5 whole seconds on my last attempt of the day! 

To me, it’s both the end and the beginning. 5 seconds was enough to hold myself comfortably in position - it can only go forward from here.

Hopefully my core will continue to strengthen to the point where I can begin walking with my hands. Damn it feels good to be a gansta.

Another question I have is about moving onto power yoga. Currently I'm not in great shape, my arms/shoulders will start to shake when doing a lot of downward dogs, planks and side planks. Should I wait until I've become really stable and comfortable in those types of poses before I move onto the more intense power yoga? It seems logical to me.",yoga

474,Headstand question,"My neighbor recently went to a yoga class with me.  She’s in her early 60’s and has been doing yoga for well over 30 years.

I’m a guy in my late 40’s, been doing yoga for 3 years.  So I’m not comparing what I can do versus what she can do... but I have one question I haven’t figured out.

During inversion, she went into a headstand on her matt.... and folded her legs kinda in a lotus position and closed her eyes and that was it.  She held that effortlessly for a solid 5 minutes, and told me later she could fall asleep doing a headstand.  I believe her.

For me?  I’m up against the wall, straining to hold a headstand for 1 minute.  Even though I’ve been doing yoga 3 years, I just started with the headstands a few months ago.

So aside from a big experience gap, there’s something else going on....

Her headstand is effortless, mine requires a lot of upper body effort to hold myself up and not put all the pressure on my head.

How is that possible that she can do the same thing with no effort?  What am I missing conceptually?

480,Bikram and SI joint,"I've heard and read lots of conflicting info. about Bikram and the SI, so wanted to see what the thoughts are here. Some people say that Bikram is the worst for the SI, and other say it's healed them.

I'm asking because I just had an SI flare up (bed for 3 days and now 3 weeks of still having some pain). I've had to significantly ramp down the intensity of my yoga practice, of course. I'm thinking of using bikram as a way to get back into the swing of things and at least maintain the endurance and strength I have built through my previous routine (3-4 vinyasa or power classes, 2-3 gentler or slow flows per week.)

My fear is that I will keep doing super gentle and sacrum-focused yoga (which I've been doing since my flare-up) and end up losing all of the strength and endurance I've built thus far through my practice. I'm also feeling like (just kind of gut feeling about my body) that I should push through the discomfort a little bit and it will help my body heal. And I'm also thinking that the heat might be beneficial in this case. 

But again, everything I read and hear is contradictory -- and also I feel like my body is telling me to ramp things back up a bit (which is maybe dumb to listen to in the case of a medical condition, but... just saying).

Therefore I would like to find a good teacher who is passionate about yoga and can teach me some solid basics and rotations that will be a good foundation to develop from. 
I like the energetic aspects of ashtanga but also simplicity of hatha. Some day, being able to stand on my hands would be incredible.
Incorporating elements such as mantras is also welcome but not necessary.

I am not picky, just looking for a true genuine teacher who will gladly teach me. I also practice vipassana meditation around 1-2 hours daily which I have heard is possible to do in combination with yoga.

501,Teaching to Varied Mobility Levels,"Hey yogis!

200 hour RYT with a few years of teaching experience here looking for advice. I'm teaching a class with very widely varying levels of mobility. It's not just a mixed level class (beginner, intermediate, advanced), I'm talking folks with regular practices alongside folks who have serious difficulty moving from seated to standing and vice versa.

My approach thus far has been:

* offering tons of props (including chairs)
* providing A/B/C options for most poses (A being very supported or seated, B being what many might consider standard, and C being more challenging)
* tending toward a more restorative practice so that everyone can reap the benefits of support and no one is rushed into or out of poses

But it still feels like teaching two separate classes simultaneously. Any tips?

ETA:

I'm of course teaching primarily to those who have mobility problems and may need some additional support to avoid discomfort and injury. I think it's wonderful that such a wide variety of students come to practice, and I want to meet them where they are. I know that the more advanced practitioners can more or less lead themselves, but I want to make sure they don't feel neglected as well. ",yoga

A little background on my situation. About 4 months ago, I hurt my lower back bending to put down two 40-pound dumbbells. MRI showed a minor disk bulge and some edema in the muscles. I went through 4 weeks of physical therapy but my back still doesn't seem right. I just signed up at a hot yoga studio (never been to a yoga class before) to give it a try because I know that stretching is something I need so desperately to get better at. Yesterday was my first class which was a ""Gentle Yoga + Yin."" I thought it went well and I really enjoyed some of the stretches, but the most apparent issue I had was the tightness in my hamstring and hip area. I struggle just holding a seated position with my legs straight. If I lie down, I can get my leg straight up to only about a 45 degree angle or maybe less, before they start shaking. I honestly think this level of tightness is what facilitated the injury in the first place. I'm open to any advice on how to approach getting the hamstring area loose, even if it means simple exercises that I can do at home.

I like taking classes although I will practice a small amount at home. I don't really feel like I'm doing yoga unless I practice at a studio once or twice a week.

I started practicing yoga at a flow style studio. I really enjoyed that, but certainly felt that it was about the workout first and the deeper practice was secondary. It's still a good school, but the classes were large and the teachers didn't dig too deeply into proper posture - oh, and the music! - some of it ""yoga typical"" - but some of it not. I'd almost forgotten about that. So, I did flow for about two years.

I switched to a more traditional studio and immediately enjoyed it. I liked the emphasis and deep work on specific areas of the body and specific asanas. There's much more meditation. There's no music. Overall, I feel that it's ""righter"" than the flow style. I even remember that the traditional teacher taught ujjayi breathing in a way that made sense that the flow teachers never did in two years! However, the asanas aren't as strenuous, the other students (like me) are older, and so the exercise generally isn't as vigorous. Over time though, I miss the workout and ironically I don't attend the traditional school as much and so actually feel less flexible now.

517,How to be friends with your hamstrings,"I came across this in an article I was reading about hamstrings: *It's a catch 22: We need to do yoga stretches to open their hamstrings, but we struggle to do the postures with proper alignment and effectiveness, because we have tight hamstrings.*

I'm interested to hear how people overcame their tight hamstrings. I have dealt with tight hamstrings my entire life. Sometimes I feel like I make progress, but then it's two steps forward three steps back. Eek! I want to be friends with my hamstrings. Like I want to sign a binding contract with them with no escape clause. No divorce settlement. No parole!",yoga
518,How do you know if you are doing the poses correctly?,"I have been to a decent amount of classes then started to do it at home , but even in the classes the teachers don't always have time to make sure if Im doing the poses right (most just glance over and around and move on to the next) I was told if it feels right then your probably on point, but then was corrected weeks later on my warrior which I have NO CLUE I was using my hip too much as a rest. 

Anywas, besides youtube, what else can i do? Should i maybe get a private lesson and just review all the poses so I know my poses are at least close enough/right?  The one I struggle with right now and just have been is the cow pose ( I have really tight hips) and I was able to do it completely ONCE then now after doing it at home I don't know how to practice (esp. when it hurts )

523,Hip alignment questions!,"So, I’ve been taking a yoga class this summer at my college and it has been super informational on how to properly &amp; safely get into poses, but also has helped me really begin my yoga practice (yay!). 
My hips are terribly misaligned after 5-6 years of working in restaurants where I would be on tile floors for 6-8 hours at time, shifting all my weight to my right side. This is very apparent when its harder for me to get into a pose that stretches my right side more than my left (i.e. in pigeon, my extended left leg does not feel nearly as much of stretch as my extended right does). 
SO, after telling my yoga teacher this, she told me we would be doing poses that specifically focus on hips! Of course, an 8 week class for one hour a day may not show significant change in alignment so, what kind of practice could I do every day that mainly pertain to my hips? I really would like to get them aligned as I have back problems as a result. When they are eventually aligned, will I notice slightly wider hips? I have a pretty board-straight figure lol 

Any recommendations would be appreciated!

524,Question about back bends and a possible injury...,"Hi yoga! This is my first post!! I hope the question/topic is ok to post. I recently started doing yoga at least 3-4 times a week to help manage my anxiety and so far it has been an amazing experience. I love yoga! I would say at this point in my life I’m at a comfortable, yet still challenged, intermediate level. My question is, I went into a back bend (wheel pose?) a few days ago after never attempting the pose before and I do not think my back was worked up enough. it hurt but I kept pushing myself - I know, I know - it’s been about 3 or 4 days and my back is still bothering me. I tried to do some intermediate level yin/yang yoga focusing on back strength, we did some side twists (not sure the appropriate name) &amp; my back is again hurting me. I clearly don’t know my limits. Can anyone offer any advice for soothing the pain? Should I be worried about permanent damage? How do I go forward from here? ",yoga
525,"I’m 19, fat, and have almost never voluntarily done exercise in my life. Is it a bad idea to have my first foray into yoga in a class setting, or should I start at home?","Hello /r/yoga! As the title says, I’m quite out of shape. I did dance classes until I was 15 and after that the only exercise I really get is choreography from the occasional community theatre show plus walking the family dog every now and then. As a result I pretty much feel like garbage all the time and I want to fix that. I am not self motivated *at all* when it comes to exercise (obviously), so I’m hesitant to join a gym because I feel like I’d just never go because I’d be scared to use the equipment wrong and hurt myself or something. I feel like I’d do better in a class setting where someone is directing what I do and it’s scheduled every week so I have to force myself to go. I’m not looking for a weight loss strategy really (gotta fix my diet first and that’s also on the list, but that’s a whole other post), but I would like to feel less like garbage?? I don’t know. 

What I’m wondering is whether just jumping in is a bad idea for someone like me? I don’t want to get overwhelmed or put myself in over my head to the point where I don’t want to go back ever, so should I try to practice yoga at home first to become more familiar with it? I did like one yoga workshop in high school gym class and I liked it, but that’s all the experience I have. 

Also, I’m moving to a bigger city for a co op job in the fall and I found a studio that looks good and offers “gentle yoga”. I’m hoping the fact that it’s a bigger city and I’m only there for a few months will give me some anonymity and let me get a handle on yoga before I try it in my hometown with the potential of running into people I know...

Any advice on getting started?

The last few weeks, my yoga instructor has approached me a couple times to see if i would be interested in becoming a teacher. The first couple times, I laughed and brushed it off but the last time, I actually asked him why he was asking me and it felt really good to have that conversation with him. I know I work hard at my practice and I'm in yoga for more than just a workout. It felt nice to have my hard work recognized and to know he thinks I'd be a good fit at the studio.  I am a teacher in real life already so I already know I love helping others learn new things and achieve their goals.  I'm not ready to start training yet as this is my last semester in grad school but I thought I would share this with you guys. I'm feeling kinda cool right now lol.

543,muscle action,"I had read something that seemed very simple some months ago that has recently come back to me as something quite profound, muscles only actively contract. So for example when you do a standing forward fold you are contracting the muscles in the front of your body, like your abdominal muscles, this action makes the muscles on your back stretch (passively). The implications of this are pretty big. In the example of the forward fold, it would be unwise to try to engage or place your body in such a way that would contract any muscles in the back of your body, as it would go against the natural actions of the pose!

Another example would be shalambhasana, locust pose. It is a backbend, the front of your body is stretching/expanding, but it is the back of your body that is actively contracting to make this happen! We are all aware of the backbending action, but often think of it as above the body. But we can also think lower body, the legs, the feet. The principle applies just the same here, in locust pose if you actively untuck your feet (so your feet are flat, rather at 90 degrees with leg) then they will be in a position that will aid the muscles in the back of your legs in contracting. Think cobra pose, where we are cue'd to press down the top of our feet, this is the reason why it makes sense to do just that!! 

I've been rethinking much of the poses I do with this in mind. Firelog / double-pigeon pose has been one. I had picked up at some point to practice it with feet at 90 degrees with legs (tucked). But in the pose your leg is bent at the knee, the back of your leg muscles are contracted. It is better to untuck your feet in this pose, as it will naturally fit this action. Funny thing is now that I look the pose up the first result has it pictures just as this! https://www.yogaoutlet.com/guides/how-to-do-fire-log-pose-in-yoga

553,YTT Question- Hatha Vinyasa vs Ashtanga Vinyasa,"Hi everyone,

I’ll be traveling to India from this October-April and I am planning on doing a YTT while in Rishikesh. 

I have it narrowed down to two yoga schools that I feel confident in. One teaches hatha and hatha vinyasa while the other teacher ashtanga vinyasa. 

I’m torn on which one I should take. Which one would you take? Also- if you’ve been to Rishikesh- any recommendations? 

I’m also confused on what “style” of yoga I’ll be able to teach afterwards? So, if I take the hatha course can I ONLY teach hatha yoga and same with ashtanga vinyasa? Or are there other type of classes I’ll be able to teach? Does anyone know what I mean? Haha. 

I just know of some people that took ashtanga vinyasa and I’m pretty sure they are teaching classes called “hot power flow” and stuff like that...

Also, for some background - I began practicing yoga about 7 years ago and was really inconsistent with it up until a year ago where I’ve been doing at home practice and going to a Moksha Yoga studio 4 times a week.

Judging by the area of the world it was developed and the timeframe, this is easily on par with tai chi and some of the less confrontational martial arts. Even the names of the poses (Warrior 1/2) are martial. Im not sure how, at least in the Western world, it has become associated with women for the most part. Yoga is clearly a form of calisthenics for the body and mind. The focus required and emphasis on calm and inner peace is surely to prepare for war. So its a Martial Art. Right?",yoga

I've been working on ""flying"" some asanas, particularly crow and pigeon. I'm having the most trouble with flying pigeon though. So some questions:

1) How open do my hips need to be? Should I be able to touch the floor with flat hands comfortably while holding half chair pose? Right now I'm touching (with some effort) just a bit past the most distal finger joints.

2) How to transition to lifting the leg up? I've managed to get my knee bent and holding there for a little bit, but I feel like I can't get enough weight onto my arms to confidently lift. I'm familiar with engaging my glutes and leaning, as I'm more capable with one legged crow. This is why I'm wondering if it's a hip restriction

3) Just how far should one lean forward? I'm not necessarily afraid of falling, but I feel like I'm almost putting my nose onto the mat...

592,I should be doing this more often - Troubleshooting,"Hello hivemind,

As with most people who work in an office, I suffer with the usual aches and pains but they keep becoming increasingly severe. The doctor recommended that I should take up yoga, or at least practice some certain poses which she kindly printed. This was early last year.

I've got a mat, couple of foam blocks and a strap which came in a really cheap starter pack; I'd like to upgrade the mat in due course but want to justify it with a regular routine. The regular routine is where I'm struggling...

It's often fairly uncomfortable because I don't really own any stretchy clothing, so I'm thinking that a pair of compression shorts may help. I've also found Yoga with Adrienne to be remarkably frustrating because of the constant inane talking; this then makes me want to give up. I genuinely don't have the time to go to a class and as a result I try to do my stretches early morning when I can bring myself to face the slippery mat, annoying video and uncomfortable crotch (I'm male).

Where do I go from here? I've read through the FAQ where there are tonnes of resources, books and courses but I don't know where to start in my situation. I would still class myself as an inflexible newbie, but at least I know what I'm getting myself in for. 

* For the guys: will the compression shorts relieve a lot of frustration?
* Should I start to look for a less slippery mat? I think this was the Diadora starter pack (very thin with little traction on the wood floor).
* Any highly recommended alternatives to Adrianne? ",yoga

I was hoping some yogis can help me answer a few questions, as I miss yoga dearly  (I used to practice daily for the past 3 years). Have any of you dealt with plantar fasciitis?

597,Shoutout to yoga for helping me feel like myself again,"So from like 2010-2015 I had a daily practice, mostly in a studio, sweating my butt off with hot Baptiste yoga and feeling on top of the world most days. I wrote long blog posts coming to all these realizations about myself and the world. A challenge presented itself and I would go forth and conquer. I ran a half marathon! I graduated college! I got up the confidence to start  dating and began dating my now fiance! I saw the good and the potential in everything! 

Somewhere along the line, I lost yoga. I made excuses about how yoga isn't just asana, it's meditation too, but I wasn't actually ever meditating. I kept reading about  it, but never actually practicing  I became jaded and bitter pretty quickly. I would avoid spending time on my mat, I think because I was kind of ashamed of how I was acting (brief examples- someone I'm close to at work pointed out that I complain a lot, fiance and I got into a lot of arguments because I would procrastinate basic things like laundry and calling the car repair place). 

Anyway. About 2-3 months ago I realized that this wasn't how I wanted to live my life anymore, especially knowing that just 3 short years ago I was this happy go lucky early 20s chick who was always a little anxious on the inside but also hopeful and optimistic. And surprisingly, it was so easy to get back on my mat once I stopped letting my ego get in the way. It started with 10 minutes in the morning or before bed, and now I'm aiming for an hour 4 days a week with a shorter practice on other days. And I feel like I've made a complete 180- things don't seem as hard or as terrible and don't seem like as big of a deal. In general I get overwhelmed very easily and it's easy to get in my head about to-do lists, money, relationship stuff, whatever, but I feel much more capable of handling everything now. 

Anyway sorry this became a saga but I'm sitting here drinking coffee waiting to go on a run and I'm looking forward to my yoga later so I needed to share. I hope you all can relate :) ",yoga

I'm a newbie in yoga, I started a couple of months ago doing hot yoga once a week (1h classes) and I love it, but I feel like once a week is not very often and I won't actually improve or get many benefits out of it?

611,Advice for opening up the sides of the torso?,"I’ve been doing yoga semi-regularly for over a year now and one of the first things I’ve noticed about my body when I started was how tight and rigid and inflexible the sides of my torso are.  I’m actually super embarrassed that pre-yoga me was lacking so much body awareness that I never even knew my side body was tight.  It honestly never occurred to me.

How tight?  In the beginning I felt an immense amount of tightness and resistance doing even slight side bends.  The yoga videos I’ve watched encouraged me to bring my arms “up and over”, but I couldn’t even bring my arms comfortably all the way up.  They were kind of off to the side.  If I tried to push beyond my comfort zone, I felt pain in my side body, so I took it easy and figured my body would open in time.

My body HAS opened in time... kind of.  I can now get my arms up and slightly over.  Some days I progress, some days I regress.  General progress in this arena has been very very slow.

I’ve done a few different routines I found/bought online.  Pretty much all of the routines focus on alternating between heart openers and hip openers.  I’ve made progress in both.  My hips have opened beyond how I ever imagined it could be (I can do front splits and lotus pose now!)  My shoulders have opened considerably as well, though not as much as my hips.  I can now clasp my hands over my shoulder/behind my back both ways with a firm grip quite comfortably (whereas before I couldn’t even make my hands touch and needed a strap.)  And I’m getting closer to getting my palms to touch in reverse prayer.

Considering how much progress I’ve made in these other areas, I’m feeling frustrated at my snail’s pace progress at opening up my side body.  Confession: I can’t even do side angle pose.  Well, I try, but mine looks nothing like how it’s “supposed” to look.

What am I doing wrong?  Why, after over a year, am I still unable to bring my arms “up and over” like the instructor shows when doing side stretches?  Why can’t I do a proper side angle pose?  What are some poses or stretches I can do to help open up my sides?  Why are they so tight in the first place?  Am I sitting or sleeping wrong?

Tbh I’ve reached a point in my yoga practice where I’m no longer concerned with achieving the “look” of certain poses.  I just want my body to be open and limber and healthy.  Right now, my side body feels so closed still that I think it may be hindering my progress in other ways.  I need help.

Sorry for the long post that turned into a rant.  Thank you for reading.  🙏🏼",yoga
612,Any guys here find that doing Yoga attracts a lot of attention?,"I’ve been doing Yoga for about two and a half months now to build up my core and flexibility after a serious operation. I do it before and after my normal gym workouts, totalling about an hours-worth a day. I used to avoid the idea of Yoga like the plague, as I believed it was emasculating due to insecurities at the time.

After participating Yoga class by chance (I was using the room at the time in the gym and decided to just join them), I became hooked.

I’m a guy that tries to maintain focus on my workouts. Since the classes came to an end, I’ve been using the free weight area to do my own routine. But I’ve started to get this feeling that girls (and even guys) are trying to seek out my eye contact in the mirrors. I’ve seen girls change from what they were doing to almost copying me completely. Sometimes it even feels ridiculously obvious. I’ve had girls go directly in front of me despite the entire free-zone being empty. I’ve even tested some of them by looking back directly at them, which really has me convinced 

Now I could be completely wrong (and even a little crazy), but I’m starting to feel that Yoga is like a gateway to heaven for straight men. I’ve been a lifter for almost 5 years and I have never experienced girls gawping at me the way (I think) they have since I started to get good.

It find it ironic because the time I spent focusing on bodybuilding was the time I actually craved attention from women. Now I have even had girls start conversations with me just because I feel that I stand out from other lifters. I honestly feel like I can pick almost any single girl I want there without an issue.

I’ve also noticed that sex is better too. I recently started again after almost a year out and I’ve received compliments on my stamina and lasting long. 

I’m really starting to think that Yoga is a huge thing that most guys are missing out on because they feel emasculated. Seriously, I freaking love it. 

Guys: Have you had a similar experience since starting Yoga? Has it improved your experience with women in general? 

Ladies: How often do you come across these kind of guys? Is there anything in particular that grabs your attention?

Some context: I mainly wanted to join to help increase my flexibility(I do a lot of martial arts and didn't want to keep feeling like I'm being held back from improving over time because of my stiff AF body). I was pretty nervous as hell initially, especially about the possibility about being the only male in a room full of highly fit and flexible women and feeling like I'm awkwardly intruding on their space. But afterwards, I immediately saw how welcoming everyone was at the yoga studio I attended, and the instructors so far have been super helpful in helping me with the basics. And even though I felt like I looked like a total idiot figuring out all these new poses and stretches throughout the whole class, a couple very good looking ladies walked up to me afterwards and said they were really impressed with my effort and ability for my first ever class(It's pretty likely that they were just saying it to be nice and encouraging, but hey, I'm still taking it as an ego boost and even more reason for motivation ;)  ). 

Most importantly though, I have never felt so energized and refreshed immediately after a workout before. As much as I also enjoy martial arts and weight training, I feel pretty exhausted for a several hours/good chunk of the day after a tough workout before I get that fresh energy boost. Yoga so far feels like instant gratification in comparison, which is awesome and I can already tell is a really addicting feeling!

649,After starting a yoga practice I feel like I need to stretch all the time! Is this normal?,"When I first started my practice I realized how dang good it felt to stretch in the poses, and I fell in love with it. However I’ve noticed that some days I feel like stretching all the time. I get this sensation that causes me to want to do it. It’s like when you wake up in the morning and feel like you need to stretch. 

Could it be because my body is becoming more flexible it craves stretching more? Am I just addicted to the feeling? 

I am getting sorta concerned about it, since obviously I can’t just stretch all day. I have been practicing for 4 months now, if that makes any difference. I also crave getting a massage, if that means anything. And not just because they feel good; it seems like it would make the feeling go away. 

Thanks for your insight! 

TL;DR: Since starting yoga 4 months ago, my body has been craving stretching and can’t get enough of it. It feels great, of course, but I can’t stretch all day. I’m not sure if this is normal or if I’m addicted to it, or if it’s something else. ",yoga

- female turning 40 soon
- started yoga in Sep 2017, and lost 15 pounds from then until now... can’t seem to lose more
- yoga classes 3-5 times a week, and often I’ll jog 5 miles once a week in place of a class
- classes are in a hot studio with infrared, and include HIIT cardio segments

I feel like losing about 10-15 pounds more will increase flexibility, balance, endurance, etc. But losing weight is getting harder with age 🙄

I exercise so much that I get depleted when I don’t eat enough. To be able to work out, I eat a significant amount of calories. Most of my intake is through fish, nuts, avocado, and high fat dairy. Some gluten free grains. Not much meat. 

I wonder if increasing carbs through fruit and grains will trigger intense cravings and make it harder to lose the weight. Or will they help?

I’m also pretty sore in my muscles most of the time... which I don’t mind, but it baffles me bc I should be adapted to the workouts by now. Maybe I need to incorporate supplements?

Any help is appreciated.

TLDR: I’m nearing the 40 hill and want to lose weight without depleting myself. I love working out. Is there  a way to do this with balance?",yoga

669,will balancing postures in bikram yoga help me even out my hips?,"I've gone to bikram yoga class 4 times so far and I always take a day of rest after, so today is my rest day and I'll go again tomorrow.

Is all bikram yoga the same? Because the one I go to, all they ever do is the same sequence over and over again. We start with this weird breathing exercise to ""warm up from the inside"" even though its a billion degrees in there, then we do a bunch of balancing postures, some squat/lunge like postures and then back postures, then some floor things. The thing I struggle with the most is the balancing ones.

My hips are uneven, I have lateral pelvic tilt and also a right rotated hip, and I was hoping this would help correct it. That's the whole reason I started doing it. I mean, I was hoping it would because I thought for sure it was caused by muscle imbalances and even my physiotherapist said so.
I chose bikram because I enjoy the heat and think all other yoga is boring so I thought the heat would give me incentive to go, and it does.
The bikram yoga teacher told me that my balancing difficulties are most likely due to my uneven hips and that he thought it would help, but it's not getting any better, and in fact, yesterday I was feeling weaker than the first 3 classes I did!!!!!!!

I'm feeling discouraged. Do you think I should keep going, like will this help my hips, or just make things worse?

I really suck at the balancing postures (most likely because of my uneven hip issue), and it's definitely not just lack of balance, although I do struggle with a definite lack of balance... but the stabilizing muscles in my hips and legs tire so fast, incredibly fast, and it's a lot worse on one side than the other, so I'm guessing that IS a muscle imbalance. I'm just feeling really discouraged because I'm not new to working out, I've been bodybuilding and playing sports for years, so I don't know why I've developed this muscle imbalance and why I'm struggling so much with the balancing postures. The muscles that are responsible for keeping me upright on one foot are so weak, I just don't know how that even happened and I'm hoping this will help get me in better shape but I'm worried I'm doing it for nothing and that it won't help.

671,The Big Secret,"The big secret of yoga is that you will make the most progress outside of class. Yoga classes are really for demonstrating flexibility (especially your average Vinyasa class). If you actually want to become flexible you need to do fascia massages and hold poses for longer periods of time depending on what your body needs. It is worth learning the Ashtanga sequence so you have a yoga sequence you can run through at any time, holding poses for longer as you body requires.

Don't get me wrong - you will def get stronger and more flexible doing classes but it is only practicing yoga mindfully on your own where the real power lies. ",yoga
672,"Is Iyengar yoga crazy, or was my Iyengar teacher crazy?","I've been practicing yoga for more than 10 years now.  I am frankly not ""good"" at yoga for being in it so long, but yoga has changed my body and mind for the better and I truly love it.  In short, I am pretty good at embracing the spirit of the practice, if not at actually doing all the bendy stuff.  

In all my time in yoga I have had the fortune to see many styles of teaching and many styles of yoga.  Today however, was by far my worst yoga experience.  I went to an Iyengar class with a teacher who was a former director a well known Iyengar school.  From the beginning the class was pretty mean and disjointed.  The teacher made snide comments because I put my mat against a wall, but then told us all to move up against the wall.  The teacher had weird comments about the fact we grabbed some foam blocks but didn't tell us at the beginning to grab the wood blocks he apparently preferred.  It went on like this.  The dude just always had a condescending way to say everything.  I was expecting lots of talking through basic poses, but I wasn't expecting it to be so unhinged, disorganized, and disrespectful.  Nothing in the class was particularly difficult (or useful to be honest).  It was just the attitude.

Ultimately my wife, who has developed a very strong practice over many years, just up and left class, something I have never seen her do before.  I've seen a lot of teachers that are authoritative, but never really mean.  And I have seen a lot of teachers who are inexperienced, but never felt they were incompetent.  This guy was mean and incompetent and I found the experience baffling.  I read more about Iyengar and it sounds like it can tend towards being a bit regimented.  Is this what all these classes are like?  The whole mindset seemed to be contrary to all of the humility, equanimity, and kindness that I have learned are the core of yoga.",yoga

710,What are the basic positions someone should learn when first practicing yoga?,"I will say. I have been a lurker for a while (few years) and browsed the FAQs extensively, but noticed this question is not answered directly within the FAQ, instead there are many nuanced approaches and answers to this all supported by their own logic which I can get behind. Then you have the section about reasons including 20 something year old males, depression, weight loss, etc.

But with that wealth of information, I noticed there is not a generalized one size fits all approach, and for obvious reasons. But I was wondering, what collection of poses would you recommend to a beginner and what resources would you direct them to? Of the 30 day challenge video series, many of them are not new-user friendly of course, most seem intermediate. And a lot of the FAQ's jargon seems predicated on the idea that the beginner already has some above average familiarity with yoga.

I am familiar with Antranik of course given my dedication to bodyweight fitness and as a result figured I would just default to his videos, but I noticed although I was technically able to follow along and keep up, it was not beginner friendly.

My roommate is slightly interested in yoga but years ago apparently he was into it, and he mentioned I should start with the 8 Somerset poses, but I looked into that and it seems that claim of his wasn't necessarily backed by any sort of science and given the questionable validity of the claim as well as his mediocre credentials, I didn't know how much value to place on that recommendation after researching into it, my research seemed underwhelming comparatively speaking to what he implied.

I was just wondering, if you do not know for certain of course that is fine, but in your opinion and experience, as I am currently soliciting as much as possible, what do you think the best approach for a beginner would be? I am specifically curious as to what collection of poses you would recommend to the average person.

Keep in mind I am heavily familiar with the FAQ, so I am not looking for that information, but either new information or your perspective on existing information within the FAQ.

Now keep in mind I am specifically not including information about myself because I do not want an answer tailored to me, I just want to know your specific opinion about what you would recommend to a beginner. That said, once that inquiry is satisfied, feel free to give personalized advice and support it with anecdotes if you want.

713,Yoga during pregnancy,"I've been doing yoga for a few years now, tried some clases but prefer to practice in the peace and quiet of my own home. I'm now 15 weeks pregnant, haven't done much since finding out, but I'd like to get back into it.
  

 
 


  
What poses should I avoid? Most of the info I've found is about the bump getting in the way (which I don't really have yet). I know that the general rule (pregnant or not) is to stop if there is pain/discomfort. Is there anything else I need to be wary of? I.e. are there things I could be doing that feel ok but are actually causing damage without me knowing? 
  

 
 


  
Conversely, if there are any poses that you find work wonders during pregnancy then hit me up with your recommendations! Any other resources, aps, etc would also be appreciated :)",yoga

Basically, I am 99% sure that I have a hernia in my belly button. I understand that I need to see a doctor for advice but it will probably be a while before I go. Whatever responses I get here I promise I won’t take as an expert medical recommendation. I wanted to know if anyone could shed light on what yoga poses I could use to help maybe close it up a bit more. I am researching online and have read a bit of conflicting information. For example, I read that you should avoid poses where you bend sharply at the waist, but then somewhere else saw a suggestion to do forward bend pose. I don’t want to hurt it further and would like to do something to help it until I can get to the doctor. I know the muscles around it are weak due to being out of shape and also pregnancy within the past couple of years. I’d like to strengthen them up.

one thing that I find ridiculous and I cannot find an excuse for teachers doing that:

Before the class, some teachers say ""Say hi to someone you don't know"" or ""Introduce yourself to a person next to you"".

I absolutely cannot stand that. In years of living in SF I have encountered that many times, and if I remember the teacher's name I will not attend their class again. This forced smiling and ""Haaaai my name is Blah..."" drive me nuts. I asked my yogi friends many times - nobody likes it! I never remember the names or faces as we do not have any meaningful interactions during the class. Of course, I could sit through it with a straight face but that is also an effort in an unpleasant situation. I find these moments so unpleasant! And it's a kick off for the yoga class.

(More specifically I finished Yoga with Adriene Revolution day 24 two days ago) I haven’t followed Adriene but have continued a few of my own stretches over the past couple of days. So the point of this is that I’m someone who has a past history with very severe anxiety. I was bed bound and completely agoraphobic for 2 years and then for another couple of years after that I somewhat functioned but was still a complete mess. With a lot of patience I got better, so better that for the past 2 years I’ve been doing fantastic. I’ve been working toward my dreams and absolutely love life, anxiety was 100% a thing of the past to the point where it was hard to believe I was ever so bad. That is, until 5 days ago. I felt a little off on Friday, mentally foggy and a little down. I didn’t think much of it and continued my regular routine which included yoga. Well I’ve progressively gotten mentally worse with each day since and it’s honestly to a point where it is scarily similar to what I experienced in the past, I’ve already been having a hard time functioning again.

I’ve just been trying to think about what could have caused this and I’ve heard a lot about yoga releasing emotions and that is the only thing I’ve really changed recently. Could the yoga potentially be bringing my history with crippling anxiety back to the surface? The thing is, it has done wonders for me physically already. My lower back pain is basically gone and I am definitely stronger and slightly more flexible. I actually crave doing it now and will be sad to stop but I also have to put my mental health first. So I’m just wondering if the “emotional release” that I hear about could be something like this? ",yoga

Had anyone used yoga trade web site for finding yoga jobs around the world? They require $36 membership fee in order to apply for jobs so before I pay I want to see if anyone has had any experience with this site. Thank you :) ",yoga

788,Stopped doing Yoga and Knee is acting up?,"Unintentionally, i let things get so busy that I've only been doing yoga once a week tops. 

For the past months now, my left knee has been sore?

- Difficulty sitting cross-legged without it complaining. 

-Pain in doing basic stretches (such as lifting that foot to the opposite knee). 

-Hell of a time sleeping on that side. 

I'm wondering three things. 

-Has anyone else had trouble like this? 

-Are the two connected? 

-Can I use yoga to fix it, if so any suggested poses? 

Thanks in advance ya'll. I'd like to get this cleaned up soon as it's beginning to interfere with both my work and my meditation practice. ",yoga

791,Sore knees during TTC,"Picture of the posture
http://imgur.com/a/9sqr0HL

I can sit like this comfortably for about 20min, then the pressure/discomfort sets in...  Doesn't hurt while walking/running/practicing, literally just while sitting.

Feels like my LCL...  Much worse on my right leg, especially when the right leg is on top (picture has left leg on top).  I'm not flexing the knees to the ground or anything, just letting them passively sit on the ground.  However, the past couple days my right knee has been floating up and getting tighter.

Was considering getting some dit dat jao when I get home, but I still have a week left of TTC and many more hours of sitting cross-legged in meditation/class/satsang...

792,Manduka Prolite wasn’t as slippery as I expected," I’ve been getting into practicing yoga in the last two years and have been using a yoga mat that I believe is a cheapy tjmaxx mat I got 10 yrs ago when I tried some pilates. I researched for a week using this subreddit and amazon reviews on what nice yoga mat I should buy. I ended up with a Manduka Prolite. I was so surprised when I got it that it is LESS slippery than my cheap one. Apparently I’ve had a crazy slippery mat and never knew haha. 


I am still doing the recommended salt 24 hr thing to wear it in, but even as is it wasn’t very slippery. I just thought I’d post this for anyone picking out their first nice mat and let them know there is no reason to be afraid of all the slippery claims if they’re starting with a cheap mat. 


I’m so excited to start practicing on my new mat tomorrow! ",yoga

795,Can yoga cure my depression?,"Background: I'm a 34 year old male and have suffered from depression for most of my life.  I am in therapy and take antidepressants.  I recently signed up for a 3 month yoga pass at a nearby studio after reading ""yoga for depression"".

My goal is to do 2-3 classes a week and then some short practice at home on the off days.  I'm expecting that this will help cure my depression and allow me to stop taking my antidepressants.

Is this realistic or an I wasting my time?",yoga
796,How to follow along on YouTube?,"So I'm having this issue that seems everyone must go thru but I can't find an answer to it.

How am I supposed to follow a routine without watching the screen?  How do you keep up with the movements when half my time I'm eating mat?    

Is the only answer to watch these videos twice?  Or will it just be that you pick up poses as time goes?  ",yoga

798,Chaturanga to updog help,"I'm finally back into a regular yoga practice after having my two kids. I never had a great vinyasa, but I am determined this time to get it right.

I've been doing the modified vinyasa (come to knees and then low cobra) and I'm ready for chaturanga. I feel really in control of lowering down safely, strongly and slowly. BUT! I can't for the life of me get to updog afterward. I feel really unsteady and like I'm going to face plant.

Any suggestions for an in between transition after I'm down in chaturanga? ",yoga
