27,New to the sub? New to yoga? Start here.,"Version 2018! Copypasta continues. 

If you are new to the sub or new to yoga, WELCOME! There is an immense amount of information available in this sub, and an excellent community of people. 

If you have a question, PLEASE check out the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) and try search before creating a new post. As noted in rule 2, commonly asked questions are removed and directed to the above. 

**The updated version of the 'usual' sticky thread:**

This post is intended as a repository of pertinent info, including updates for new and ongoing issues. For the sake of visibility, we'll try to include links as pertinent.

**Reminders:**

* It's in the sidebar, it's in the rules, it's in the note when you create a new post. *PLEASE utilize search and the FAQ before creating a new post.* Especially around the first of the year, it's not unusual to see 3 versions of the same post in a day, asking questions that are well covered in the sub. If your post is removed because the answers are available there the mod team is not scolding you, we're just letting you know why it was done and reminding you that the answers you seek already exist. And yes, the mod team finds themselves busy doing just that this time of year. 

* /r/yoga is not the place for medical advice. This is always a handy reminder.
* **Addendum to the above** - Yoga philosophy and western medicine are different. There is room for both in this sub. This means that things like subtle bodies and energy (prana) movement and chakras *all have a place here* as well as discussion from a western perspective. There is no demand that anyone agrees with what is presented, but rule 1 applies in these cases- be respectful. 

* Yes, we have a [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/index) and [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/faq) . (And they're awesome.)
The FAQ and search are the best places to start if you're new to yoga or have questions about styles, equipment, injuries, or resources. Plans in the works include a section for teachers, expansion of the section regarding yoga and other activities, and potentially an additional section for the questions that are common that to add to the FAQ would continue to grow an already large document. More FAQ updates will be coming, but in the meantime, we have continued to leave up questions that haven't been in awhile to keep more up-to-date information available when it exists.

* Yes, they're even available via app and mobile. Yes, really. (The sidebar, too!) It can take a little looking, but we haven't yet found an app without access to the sidebar.

* Reddit's guidelines are still the foundation of how we approach spam in /r/yoga, and bans will continue to be a thing as needed. Need the details? Reddit's guidelines are [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion).

* This sub is not for market research. It's a community. Requests for the sub to tell you what we love or hate about our yoga mats and t-shirts will be removed, as will asking us to fill out surveys for that or your thesis research. Those are not the only such examples. When in doubt, feel free to message the mods ahead of time. Established community members can message mods ahead of time for permission on a case-by-case basis. 


**Other notes:**

* The automoderator is in use and working relatively well in terms of catching spam, and the mod team continues to monitor what is being automatically removed. Sometimes we catch them in the first 5 minutes, but sometimes it's a few hours between mod sweeps. If you've posted something that isn't showing up, you're welcome to message the mods (keeping in mind that it's possible it will be a bit before a mod sees it- please be patient!) and ask about it- including a link is much appreciated.

* Your mod team is human (you totally thought we were unicorns and rainbow-chasing leprechauns, but aside from cosplay and Halloween, not so much). Part of modding is making judgement calls, and sometimes we remove things that we can't be sure there isn't a bot behind that turns out to be totally legit because another real, in-the-flesh reddit user actually did post. :) Much like the point above, feel free to ask.

* The discussions on the Sutras have been collected on a wiki page [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/wiki/sutras). Feel free to continue contributing to those threads as well as the current one. 

* As with the last update, COMP remains as-is. The mod team is done rehashing this topic, which will likely result in the posts questioning COMP that inevitably happen every time someone new finds them questionable being removed and referred to [search](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/search?q=COMP+self%3Ayes&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;count=25&amp;after=t3_39saiq), until/unless the overall focus in the sub shifts substantially. For those unaware and interested, /u/BeyondMars posted [the following](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/48aaq2/should_an_individual_moderator_make_decisions/d0i424h) last time it came up to get everyone up to speed- here's the section on rule 4, to which I added the link:

&gt;&gt;&gt;   Search the history of this sub for discussions on [COMP] poses. [Probably two years ago now?](https://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/1i9x4s/mod_post_state_of_the_subreddit_reminders_selfies/) There is a VERY LARGE part of this sub that doesnt wan't them to have a place here at all. The gist of it is that people come to reddit and dont want it to be like another yoga instagram, or something, I dont know. But there were portions of time in this sub when our ENTIRE front page was yoga pics. COMP was an effort to a compromise that would allow people to filter them out if they didnt want them there... In regards to the self-doxxing aspect. Sexual harassment, and online bullying have originated in this sub at least four times that I was made aware of. This rule was instituted to keep everyone safe. I don't care if YOU want your instagram accounts on the sub (self promotion?) but we are keeping people safer with this rule and the way we enforce it. Its going to stay. Take the extra 2 minutes and upload it to imgur.

28 June addition: 

It seemed obvious to the mod team when it was discussed a week or so ago, but for the sake of clarity, it's being noted here as well and will continue to be enforced, *especially* on COMP posts:

**Sexual/sexualized/objectifying comments are not welcome here. Removals are guaranteed, and warning vs. ban will be handled on a case-by-case basis.** 

Just don't. It all falls under rule 1.

In short by intensely meditating on something, you attain its powers.

31,Postnatal yoga advice?,"Hello! I’m cleared from my doctor and would like to slowly get back into my yoga routine. I’ve been doing simple salutations most days but need a longer flow sequence now. I would like to use online resources since leaving the house with my little guy is nearly impossible right now.

What is the best way to ease back in? I started slacking off around third trimester and am 2 months post partum now, so it’s been almost 5 months since I’ve really been practicing.

I’ve done yoga with Adriene and fightmaster yoga in the past. I feel like fightmaster is too fast and hard right now but ywa doesn’t quite do it for me. I dislike her chatter and really just need someone to help lead a guided flow.

I’ve tried some free flow but I think since I’m so out of practice right now I need a little guidance, plus I always resort to the same few poses and like the suggestions of things I don’t think to go to.

I guess I’m looking for suggestions for online classes/instructors and also any advice to get back into practice. I find it hard to get a long flow in (I’m usually interrupted within 20 minutes) so that has been frustrating. I keep telling myself any yoga is good. 

I’m really struggling with my body post partum. I feel so weak and everything is so tight. I would like to gain some strength and flexibility back so I can begin to feel more like myself again.",yoga
32,Found my way back to yoga last night,"Hey everyone, just wanted to share some thoughts I had last night.  

I started practicing yoga in March of this year by following YWA's videos on YouTube. I started with her Revolution series and then went into True. Loved both of those! My shoulder hurt a little bit one day, so I decided to ease up on practicing every day. Well, I quickly fell out of practicing at all. The shoulder pain went away after a day or two but I just couldn't get back into it. At the same time, I was also going through a rough patch in my life. I knew yoga would help because I had been feeling so good while doing it but I was just feeling discouraged about a lot of things in life. Even though the shoulder pain went away I felt like what's the point of getting back into it if I'm just going to have to stop again if my shoulder starts hurting?  

I got into yoga in the first place because of lower back pain from sitting at a desk all day and this pain has returned since I stopped practicing yoga. So two nights ago I decided to start being more consistent (I had started Yoga Camp but hadn't gotten far). Last night I did Day 8 and it was exactly what I needed. The whole sequence was on the floor and a lot on the back (plus she said to grab a pillow, I love when yoga involves a pillow!) I loved it so much I found another random yoga for back video and followed that one too for a full hour of relaxing, peaceful, back healing yoga. It was the first time in a while I didn't care how long the video would be or how much time I'd have left before I had to go to sleep. I was just focused on helping my back to feel better.  

I think I'm going to focus on mostly restorative and gentle yoga for now, since that's what my body seems to like most. I'm only in my late 20s so it's kind of depressing to me to think I can't do the level of physical activity I want to do, but I know that's only temporary. I need to be kind to myself, take it easy, and listen to what my body is telling me. If my shoulder starts hurting again I'm going to go get it checked out. I hate setting up appointments with doctors or for anything really but I know it's important to take care of myself. I imagine a world where I'm not in pain and have the energy to do what I really want to do in life. I can get there but I need to give myself a helping hand.",yoga
33,Teachers- how do you usually plan a class? Or do you even plan your classes?,"I usually practice on my own and then write out the sequence that came up, unless a student makes a request. Depending on who comes I usually switch up the pace or sequence. I sped about an hour sometimes less when I plan and write out a class sequence. In teacher training we were taught to always have a peak pose and theme which I sometimes do but usually the theme arises when I’m in the moment, about to teach. Sometimes there isn’t even a distinct theme, and I think that’s okay. My students are happy and i have definitely found my groove when it comes to planning out and teaching a fun class, however I would love to hear about what other teachers do :-)",yoga

37,Transition from Downward Facing Dog to Warrior 1,"I've been doing yoga for about 3 months now 3-4 times per week and one of the things I continue to struggle the most with is the transition in Sun Salutation B from Downward Facing Dog to Warrior 1. I can't seem to get my leg between my hands when I step forward and have to take a second to reposition myself causing me to fall behind the rest of the class. I must be doing something wrong, but I can't figure out what.

Do you all have any tips on how to make this transition more fluid? What can I work on that will make my step forward longer?",yoga
38,"New to yoga, lots of questions with no one to ask.","New to yoga. For reference. 6’2 male and very inflexible. I just have a bunch question because I recently started going to yoga once a week with one of my friends. Any answers are greatly appreciated 

1. Is going just once a week enough to see progress? I know I should try to go more, but i don’t really have much time unfortunately. I might find some online videos and try to do it another time a week on my own. 

2. Downward dog sucks. I have so much trouble. I’m just not flexible enough to do it right, so I’ve been doing some research on different modifications. Is the best way to just bend the legs and lift heals off the ground and make sure to keep the spine and arms aligned? 

3. Another thing regarding that, they do this thing where they lift the heals and go from toes then heal back on ground when in downward dog. Even with my knees bent I can’t really get my heel to the ground, should I just kind of pretty pressure back into my heel as much as I can, then back into toes?

4. Another thing was we did fallen triangle (I think that’s what she called it), and my arm was shaking a lot along with a few other poses. Is this a balance or a strength thing, so I know which I need to work on focus on to make it smoother and more comfortable. How long do you think it’ll take to be more... solid in this positions. 

5. Breathing. I always feel like I’m breathing wrong or out of synch with the movements she’s doing / the class. Is it okay if I do some transitions a little slower or faster?

Thank you in advance for any answers! ",yoga

44,Do people in the back of the room have the right to throw a tantrum over mirror obstruction?,I saw this very handsome lad come in a couple minutes prior to the start of class. The room was fairly full and only one patch available and it was up front near the teacher's spot. This gentleman seemed mindful enough to stagger the mat as best he could with respect to those behind whilst not encroaching upon his neighbor. This woman in the back row got up and started spiking blocks left and right going on about poor yoga etiquette. Started huffing and puffing and loudly slapping her mat on the ground to show her agitation with the heinous act. Do people in the back have a divine right to the mirror if they got there first? I will say it does bother me when someone blocks my way but only when there is plenty of real estate.

45,Trying to get into yoga but I can't even do beginner stuff,"Hello. I'm a 23 years old male ( 188cm/86kg ^^6'2""/190lb ), and I haven't done exercise for most of my life. I have mild scoliosis and I've suffered from back pain for a long time already. Lately I've been trying to make an effort to improve my health. I've tried to minimize my sitting time and improve my posture, been running regularly for a month, and yesterday I started Yoga with Adriene's 30 Days of Yoga series.

I could barely do most of the stuff for the first day, but I sticked to the end. I figured even if I half-assed most of the posses, I was still doing something and I'd eventually be able to do them properly, but today I had to stop half-way the 2nd day video because I couldn't do anything at all and I was feeling like I was about to collapse. i.e I can't plant my feet when doing Downward Facing Dog, and when doing the Half Forward Bend I can't get my hands to the floor without bending my knees and I worry that I'm rounding my back too much.

[Then, I decided to do a quick reddit search, and it seems like the consensus between xxfitness is that her routines are too easy](https://np.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/5ee7j0/does_anyone_do_the_yoga_with_adriene_videos/). Needless to say, I'm feeling really unmotivated.

My main objective is to fix my posture, gain more flexibility and learn how to not round my back and do simple things like squat properly. My end goal is to have a good foundation for doing compound lifts, as I've always been interested in powerlifting, but I'm not able to do the most basic stuff with weights so I figured I should improve my body awareness and flexibility without weights first.

I'm thinking that I might just have a mental block rather than physically not being able to do those poses correctly, but I've been sitting most of my life so I think I'm just way too stiff.

48,Is Yoga Alliance really just a corporate scam?,"I've been practicing yoga for decades, starting at ashrams in India. I have been to thousands of asana classes all over the world. Only in the last few years have I bumped into the yoga alliance phenomena - people who basically pay an American 'non-profit' a heap of money for a plaque to put on their wall.

Non of my early teachers are 'yoga alliance certified', they probably have never heard of it - and these people have been teaching yoga for many decades.

50,I finally went to a yoga class....,"and it was the best decision ever!

I have been into meditation for a few years and have always known about Yoga and heard how good it was for you both mentally and physically.

About 3 months ago I started doing some yoga at home via YouTube and found it somewhat enjoyable but (for me) it just wasn't what I was looking for.

2 weeks ago I went and signed up for a monthly membership at a local studio and since then have gone pretty much every day (11 times exactly) and have loved every part of it.

My point for making this post is that if you have been thinking about trying a yoga class but still haven't made it in...just go.  I'm a guy and was anxious about going the first time but once there I felt at home because everyone was so nice and welcoming.

I know classes may not be for everyone or maybe not in the budget right now but if you have been wondering and can fit it in the budget I think you'll really enjoy it if you just give it a try.

Alternatively if you like to keep your practice at home, keep doing you...no judgement here.

54,"Forearm popped, no pain though","So I was turning around a corner. My left arm was holding onto a nice hold, carrying some portion of my mass and probably a bit of my moment too, when I felt a peculiar ‘pop’ through the middle of my forearm. I, of course, stopped bouldering immediately. 

That was about an hour or so ago. I still don’t feel any pain, or even soreness (it’s just as sore as my other forearm... trying to get back into climbing after being unable to in the summer), but I’m still concerned about my forearm.

I retain full (painless) mobility of my entire arm, including wrist, fingers, etc. At the moment it happened, I had been climbing for a bit more than an hour, and had warmed up appropriately.

Any ideas of what the pop could have been? Should I be concerned? I’m in college, and tuition is a thing, so I’d prefer to stay out of a clinic if I can. Still, I don’t want to risk an injury. I’m thinking about giving it 3 days or a week just to be sure everything’s fuckin’-a in the grabber. 

Cheers, kindly internet strangers.

59,Finger pain: when is it fine to keep climbing and when should it be considered like a warning?,"Coming from a few years of body building, I know that pain isn't necessarily something bad, and if it's a muscular pain due to lactic acid, it is usually safe to work on it. However, I believe fingers are completely different and I never know when a bit of pain is fine for climbing or if it could lead to a serious injury.

I started bouldering two years ago and I never had any particular pain, although recently (about 3 months ago), I started pushing myself with some more difficult problems like 6b+/6c. Since then, I started experiencing some pain in the ""flashy part"" of my fingers. It usually disappear completely after warming up, but it sometimes remain until the end of the training. When I'm not training, it also happens that a very specific movement of a finger, or a very localised area, feels particularly painful, like pinching my thumb and finger while holding my hand behind my back!

My question is, based on your experience, when should I start worrying, and what do you suggest doing when the pain a ""dangerous one""?

Thank you for your comments =) ",climbing

62,Wedding Gift: Top 3 greatest climbing area books?,"Hello friends of r/climbing!

tl:dr, I’m buying 4 or 5 climbing area books/guides as a wedding gift for some crusher friends (trad, adventure, sport). What are your top three climbing area books and why?
Edit: Feel free to list your top 3 climbing areas (with our without guide books) too!

My good friends are getting married in the next few weeks and I’m working hard to get them a cool wedding present. 
They both crush and love to travel (for adventure and for climbing).
One loves trad (we live in Utah so he’s very familiar with Indian creek and LCC). And adventure climbing, the other enjoys trad/adventure but really loves sport climbing as well.
They’re both interested in environmental conservation. One is fluent in Spanish and the other in Mandarin. 
With all of that in mind I’m thinking about buying them 4 or 5 climbing area books of places they love or would someday travel to. What are your top 3 favorite climbing area books and why? What are your top 3 climbing areas and why?

Beautiful books get bonus points as well! I’m a huge fan of the new Yangshuo climbing guide!

Edit: In response to everyone who is suggesting local guidebooks: In the past I've gone halfsies with the groom on 2 or 3 guidebooks so I know he's got a stack of (half-owned) books at his place for all the Utah places he likes (Joes, Moab, The creek, SLC area, Ibex, and Maple). Just this year alone they've been to 2 or 3 (somewhere in BC, Mexico, and Croatia)  international climbing locations, and 5 or 6 other states for climbing alone. They're in to traveling and have each been to 30+ countries.",climbing

73,Shoulder Dislocation Bouldering," 

Hi guys,

In 2015  I dislocated my shoulder whilst falling awkwardly out of a handstand, the shoulder fell back in without too much effort although later that day I re-dislocated it which took a larger amount of effort to relocate. After the accident I was advised by an orthopaedic surgeon to work on strengthening the ligaments and muscles around the shoulder, and surgery might be avoidable. Over the past three years at times it has left unstable, but I have slowly worked on physical therapy till now where it has been feeling almost pain free and feeling stable . Since starting bouldering I’ve worked even more on strengthening my shoulders, understanding the stress they are under due to the sport. This in mind, while on a wall last Sunday I’ve had my left arm extended at 60 degrees and crimped down hard next thing I know I’m lying on the mat with my shoulder dislocated. I was able to manipulate my body against the mat as I could feel it would go back in. My question; is there any possibility of recovering from this without a shoulder stabilisation surgery and continue climbing? Does anyone have experience or understanding of this procedure are there any risks involved such as loss of mobility or re-occurring problems?  Would surgery with physio along with stretch therapy result in the best outcome? Or should it be avoided?

I’ve had my MRI I’m waiting for the report and will be seeing an orthopaedic surgeon in the next couple days. Would really appreciate opinion on if a conservative treatment could work. 

Thanks for your time, 

Sorry i'm not sure where the most appropriate place would be to make this post.

76,Too old for this?,"I learned the basics of climbing when I was 17, in a high school gym class oriented towards the outdoors. Challenge Gym, it was called. We learned to climb, rappel, tie knots, make our own webbing harnesses, one-handed bowlines, and how to belay. I worked for a local outfitter for years, but it was a commercial operation , and I did not meet many people willing to share climbing with me. It was some special club I couldn’t join.


I haven’t done any of this in many years. I’m 42 now, I’ve had my kids and they’re old enough to climb and mountain bike.

In general I’ve felt like the outdoors community, despite its Welcome Everyone! Vibe, is anything but. I wasn’t born to climbing so I’m not welcome. 

And now, I’m too old, or so I’m told. I can Gym climb for fun, but I’ll never get on a real rock. Yes, a gym climber told me this. I should just view this as a workout.

Sp, how do I progress? I’ve been momming for over 11 years. Is my life of adventure over because I’m too old, missed my window?

89,"Forearm popped, no pain though","So I was turning around a corner. My left arm was holding onto a nice hold, carrying some portion of my mass and probably a bit of my moment too, when I felt a peculiar ‘pop’ through the middle of my forearm. I, of course, stopped bouldering immediately. 

That was about an hour or so ago. I still don’t feel any pain, or even soreness (it’s just as sore as my other forearm... trying to get back into climbing after being unable to in the summer), but I’m still concerned about my forearm.

I retain full (painless) mobility of my entire arm, including wrist, fingers, etc. At the moment it happened, I had been climbing for a bit more than an hour, and had warmed up appropriately.

Any ideas of what the pop could have been? Should I be concerned? I’m in college, and tuition is a thing, so I’d prefer to stay out of a clinic if I can. Still, I don’t want to risk an injury. I’m thinking about giving it 3 days or a week just to be sure everything’s fuckin’-a in the grabber. 

Cheers, kindly internet strangers. 

TLDR: bouldering, felt a pop in my forearm. No pain, but I dunno what it is, and if I should be worried. ",climbing
